Two Case Studies
Case Study I
This chapter compares alienation of African-American
Haverford college students in 1972 with experiences of current
African-American students. According to my argument, recurring
themes of alienation have pervaded Haverford during the past
twenty years. Originally my hypothesis proposed that alienation
caused student protest. Evidence gathered indicates that students in
1972 felt and students in 1991 feel alienated. This should lead to
student protest.
On February 3, 1972, the Black Students League (BSL) of
Haverford College held a boycott. The Black Students League
boycotted all activities at Haverford with the exception of classes and
campus jobs. 22 The BSL issued an official statement:
Through the years, the college has maintained a
conscious and disastrous notion that it is a 'community
marked by a lasting concern of one person for another.'
It is not and it has never been. It is an institution that
which acts a deep and sickening disregard for all other
than the bourgeois white male. We have felt this
disregard in the classroom, in the dining hall, indeed, in
all aspects of life here.

We have made our complaint, our statement,
before; time and discussion passed and it was business as
usual. But not again.
Since we are not integral participants in the college
community we feel that radical action must be taken to
emphasize our outrage at the conditions which heretofore
have prevailed at Haverford.
Again, you know the issues, and in the coming days
there will be no way you can escape them. 23
According to a recent interview with Sam Foley '73, a BSL
member and member of its Communications committee, the Boycott
arose because Black students at Haverford felt that the college did
not commit itself to Black students. 24
Question: How did the BSL Boycott come about?
Response: Well a little background. My Class, the Class of
'73 was the largest influx of Black students that Haverford
had ever had in on e class...There was also a group of postback baccalaureates too. So in that one year there must
have been about 25 to 30 blacks at that point...To make a
long story short, what precipitated our activity and ""Specific
Concerns"" was the high rate of attrition among my
classmates and others and the fact that that attrition, there
was a report...and basically Haverford as I recall placed
responsibility for lack of success, or Haverford did not take
responsibility for our lack of success and we felt that that
was wrong...We knew some action had to be taken...The
decision to boycott came out of our strategy meetings that
we had. 25

Foley stated that ""the object of the Boycott was to force Haverford to
examine itself."" 26 When asked, ""Do you think the boycott came as a
surprise to the administration?"" Foley responded, ""Yes it did."" 27
An incident in 1972 explains some of the BSL concerns. On
February 7, 1972, ten Haverford administrators (Lyons Committee)
released a ""'very rough draft' of an Educational
Commitment Program"" to Students' Council and Honor
Council...to improve Haverford's effectiveness in the
education of students who, because of racial, ethnic and
economic backgrounds, are now disadvantaged at
Haverford. 28
The program would try to:
To increase campus awareness of cultural traditions in
minority groups, the proposal urged Collections devoted
to enlarging ethnic and cultural consciousness of diverse
groups. Library, dramatic, and musical programs should
take into account minority literature and arts, it stated;
'in addition, it was urged that the BSL assume more
leadership in carrying out appropriate festivals and
exhibits.' 29
The BSL criticized the ""Lyons"" committee (named after Dean James
Lyons), stating that if the committee wanted to create
a document relevant to the life and well-being of the
Black community, why were no Black student members

of the committee, or why wasn't the Black community at
least given the opportunity to examine the document
prior to its dissemination to another, barely relevant,
student organization?"" 30
Black students felt that the administration should approach them
directly when decisions concerning Black students arose. The general
Haverford community also chastised the administration for not
making the Educational Commitment Program public to the campus.
Evidently, the administration did not present the report to anyone
except select faculty, Students' Council, and Honor Council.
According to professor Sara Shumer, the Boycott involved
support for minority students in terms of Dean support, student
service support, faculty support, and having a greater presence of
African-American professors. There was concern for a summer
program to help African-American students coming from urban
areas to better adjust to life at Haverford. 31 At this time, Professor
Shumer was an assistant Professor in the Political Science
department whose tenure decision came during the 1972-1973
academic year. Along with professor William Hohenstein of the
Sociology department, Sara Shumer served as a BSL appointed liaison
between students and faculty. BSL students wanted more input in
the college decision-making process at all levels. 32 Governance of

campus life became a primary issue for Black students. For these
main reasons, the BSL held their boycott.
The Bi-College News printed a synopsis of the BSL boycott on
February 18, 1972. A chronology of the events crystallizes the issues
and subsequent action that took place. SEE APPENDIX VIII.
According to ex-President, John Coleman, the Boycott ""was
clearly the most tense time of my presidency and in many ways, the
most profoundly educational of the experiences I had at
Haverford."" 33
During the early part of the protest many of the faculty and the
administration did not understand why the BSL protested. Shumer
stated that many faculty...""didn't understand why there was a need
for change. We have one community, we accept everybody, but
people are obviously hurting..."" 34 Part of the confusion stemmed
from the fact that the BSL had not listed any specific demands.
According to Shumer, the Boycott forced the faculty and
administration to think through what they saw as the problem. This
strategy would not allow the administration to simply meet certain
demands without ""any change of heart, without any change of
consciousness, without any change of feeling about what one ought to
be concerned about."" 35
On February 20, the BSL issued a statement and list of ""Specific
Concerns"" to give to the faculty and administration. The statement

called for a 5:00 p.m. deadline on February 25, 1972 to comply with
their stated demands. SEE APPENDIX IX for the complete
statement.
The College met the 5:00 deadline by issuing a five-page pointby-point document. The administration distributed eight copies of
the budget to the BSL and Puerto Rican students, which included a
call for the reconstitution of the Study Group on Governance 'to
address the matter of institutionalized diversity;' 36 the college
suspended all admissions material to prospective students that
afternoon; the Students Council suspended operations; the Academic
Council promised to include BSL and other minority input when
'formulating policies and practices concerning the selection, hiring,
and reappointing of faculty. 37 President Coleman, in a February 23
meeting with the Board of managers, stated that he would make no
further recommendations to the Board of managers until 'minority
groups likely to be affected...have been adequately consulted.' 38 The
College initiated a counselor search committee and a minority
admission search, agreed to a visiting lecture program devoted to
minority concerns, and agreed on a seminar on the legacy of
American minorities. The faculty also supported a summer program
for those desiring and needing one. 3 9

The boycott continued with meetings between students and the
administration. On March 3, 1972, the News printed a Statement on
Institutionalization of Diversity. SEE APPENDIX X. BSL member
Ghebreselassie Mehreteab called the administration's response...'a
first step towards discussion.'40
The boycott lasted two months and three days ending on April
7, 1972. President Coleman stated that one of the main concerns
that remained after the Boycott and which persists in 1991 involved
Haverford,
""living up to the commitment with regard to faculty
appointments. Making a more aggressive effort to get
Black candidates and to some extent, in time, we began
talking about Hispanics as well but the focus was clearly
on Blacks at that time. I considered that an unfinished
piece of business when I left in 1977, and one of the
biggest disappointments I had at Haverford was a case of
an appointment where I thought we had a really
outstanding Black candidate for one appointment and
could not get it through the Academic Council...I really
felt that this was a time when we were being tested on
that commitment and when we did not really meet the
test.41

Although no immediate structural changes occurred, informal
discussions around campus kept the issues alive. The News reported
that
Members of the [BSI.] have joined other students at
meetings in several dorms, including Rhoads and Barclay.
These far ranging discussions have addressed the
problems of Haverford, its sense--or lack of sense--of
community, some students' difficulties in defining the
problems under discussion, racism, cultural ignorance,
and self-examination. League members picketed
Tuesday's Collection with placards saying, 'End racism in
the classroom, in administration, in social events.' 42
This 1972 event helps to crystallize why Black students felt
alienated from Haverford. Students did not feel that the College
committed itself to diversity. If community at Haverford meant
more than white bourgeois culture, Haverford had to make some
structural changes to insure the survival and nourishment of those
groups different from the dominant or white bourgeois group. 4 3
Black students did not have a voice in administrative policy which
directly affected them. Black students had no opportunity to learn
about their history or culture in the classroom. Sam Foley stated,
""Haverford brought us to the campus but did not see a need to
accommodate us as far as the curriculum was concerned."" 44 When
asked how he felt personally at Haverford, Foley answered:

Question: Did you feel part of the Haverford community?
Response: No.
Question: Did you feel alienated from the community?
Response : Yea, I definitely knew that what they were talking
about as far as community was concerned did not
include me.
Question: What aspects of the community did you not feel
part of?
Response: Well, because Haverford is an academic community
first and foremost, the curriculum didn't reflect
anything that addressed me as a person. It was
basically Eurocentric. 45
Alienation helped spark the Black Students League protest at
Haverford in 1972. The Boycott and administrative response tried to
incorporate Black students into the community. If instituted • correctly, the BSL's ""Specific Concerns"" should have reduced the level
of alienation among Black students and curtailed Black student
protest. By examining Haverford almost twenty years later, we see
if this assumption holds."

Letters to the Editor

Howard L. Green Associate Professor of English

lo the Editor: Professors Wittnerand Novack and their student associates depict very clearly (in the Misc Supplement ""The Profits of Death"") the immorality of IBM's participation in defense work, and their indictment of Vassar's consequent immorality in deriving pari of its funds from IBM stock is compelling. The only weakness in their presentation seems to me to lie in the actions they advocate. Having known I his administration and faculty for twenty years, I somehow find it a little hard to visualize Mr. Watson being goaded into cancelling IBM's contracts with the Pentagon because our administrators talk to their business friends or because our faculty delays approval of the technology center. Picketing I B M's plants and making, protests at IBM stockholder meetings would, perhaps, be a little more effective, but these are. after all. stale tactics. In this situation, we need to make a strong and unequivocal moral gesture. I had originally thought that the faculty could make such a gesture by renouncing that part of our salaries which is derived from war profits, hut that would entail going through the entire Vassar portfolio to determine what part of the earnings of each corporation was attributable to defense-related work and how much of that should rightly be attributed to Vassar's assets in terms of dividends received and capital gains realized (adjusted, of course, for stock splits and dividends declared, stock rights issued, and pooling-of-interests due to mergers consummated-if an) -during the holding period). However, as I re-read the Misc Supplement. I realized that all these computations would be not only time-consuming but unnecessary. For. as Professor Wittner and his associates make abundantly clear. IBM as a whole is responsible for the morality of its parts, and 1 am sure they would not want themselves or the Vassar community open to the charge of preaching what they are not willing to practise. If. therefore, we all really wish to avoid this charge, as long as \ ass,ir College retains any stock in .my corporation involved in defense work, we—as members ol the Vassar faculty—should re nnoun C c our salaries completely . In that way . 1 feel, our protest would attract worldwide attention, it would arraign with one stroke not only IBM but all corporations involved in defense work, and-most important of all—our moral position would be impregnable. . . which I'm afraid it isn't for any of us who stay on the payroll. II Professors Wittner and \ov.ick would take the lead in this matter, they would certainly attract a large and enthusiastic following among the faculty, and the students would know once and for all which of their teachers were truly righteous at heart and which were (however secretly) mere lackeys of the Establishment. In conclusion, I hope thai students who read this will not think of il merely as another example of the tired old tradition of the faculty arrogating to itself all the important rights and privileges. By no means! I think thai students should have the same rights and privileges as members of the faculty, including the right and privilege 01 self-sacrifice. In this particular situation, having no salaries, they cannot very well renounce them, But since the annual lee which a student pays is S 1400, and since (according to latest figures) each student costs the college 15800! ever) student gets 12400 free and deal frOKI the College anriu.illv Because tins money comes from gills. c n d o w m c n I and o I he i investment income (all oi it

necessarily tainted by war profits), those students who wished to support this movement could do something every bit as dramatic as the faculty by making the college take back this $2400 every year. Perhaps Mr. Lieverman and Miss Ridgway, as co-signers of the Vassar-Watson Correspondence, might want to start the ball rolling. Sincerely yours."

Requirements Under Fire""Trick the Timm-Boycott Gym""

BY LISA ELLIOTT

Opting for total abolition rather than reform, a small group of students has been conducting a boycott of stillmandatory gym classes. In the meanll m c. the curriculu m committee, which met with the physical education department earlier in the year to work out a system of partial exemptions, will see the department again to discuss further changes in requirements. The boyeotters are a group with no name, no leaders and little formal structure. Their presence is evidenced mainly through signs asking students to stay away from class. These have appeared intermit tantly on bulletin boards, random trees - especially near Kenyon - and on the closely-watched ride boards. The signs bear original slogans, such as ""Tnck the Timm - Boycott Gym"" as well as old standards like ""Hell no. we won't go."" Objections to a two-year physical education requirement, recently amended to exempt those students who can demonstrate high intermediate skill in two single or dual sports

and have taken one fundamentals course, include the contention that students who have reached the college level should no longer be forced to go to classes. Their main argument, however, is that since the college plans to admit next year a large freshman class that includes, foi the first time, male students. expansion oft he gy m department will provide an unnecessary expense in an administration that is trying to eliminate a 51.2 million deficit. The question of gym requirements was also brought up in a letter from SGA president Marty Beyer to Dana Birnbaum. chairman of the curriculum committee. The letter advised Dana that the Senate Conference Committee feels that the physical education program should be abolished, except for testing of new students at the beginning of each year and maintenance o I recreational facilities at Kenyon. It also asked Dana to arrange meetings of the curriculum committee and the gym department to discuss such changes. Miss Beyer asked that the

curriculum committee consider the following five problems: 1 I How can the physical education faculty be decreased? 2) Wow will a decrease in gym requirements affect the use ol recreational facilities at Kenyon? 3) Is the formation of informal intramural teams a possible alternative to the requirement 4) How can facilities be improved by the changes in requirements? 5) What budget changes will be made? Before Miss Beyer's letter, the curriculum committee had already planned meetings with the physical education department at the request ot Miss Richey of the department. Miss Richey asked to have such meetings because she saw the boycott as one way ot approaching a problem that she believes can be solved more easily through the curriculum committee. The plans for a meeting. however, remained tentative until Miss Beyer's letter because the question of physical education requirements never seemed urgent. In a

questionnaire issued at the beginning of the year, students listed this problem as last in priority of the things for the curriculum com mi t tee to discuss, behind such things asgrading, interdepartmental programs, and honor system. Physical Education requirements will now be discussed by members of the curriculum committee as soon as a subcommittee that includes students both in favor of and actively opposed to present requirements. Meanwhile, the department notices little changein class attendance, and the increase in protest is limited to an extra sign outside the dining room."

The plans for the Moratorium this spring are directed at focusing attention on the monetary and moral drain on America caused by the continuation of the war in Vietnam, the war continues to preoccupy and divide this country, while inflation, caused largely by the billions of dollars allotted lo wage the war, has become the nation's primary domestic concern. To raise the issue of the morality of the war as well as its disastrous economic impact, the national and local moratorium groups have outlined a two-part program, [Taxpayers' Rallies (often re-enactments of the Boston lea Party) on April 15 and a nation-wide three day fast for peace on April 13,14, and 15 have been organized. To build widespread public support for an immediate end to the war, it is critical that the anti-war groups address themselves to national issues of broad concern. The issues of inflation and high taxes as attributable to extravagant defense budgets must be clearly brought to the taxpayers of this country. The Vassar anti-war community must join this effort and actively work for its goals. This means going to the people - in Poughkeepsie and home towns to leaflet in shopping centers, business sections. IRS and income tax centers; to help organize tallies, and to urge members ol the community to express then concern to their local representatives - in congress, unions, churches, schools, or places of business. The direct participation ot the workers, homeowners, businessmen, and the poor in the April 15 activities can become a dramatic call for the stabilizing of the economy the reordering of priorities, and the termination ol the war. The second phase of the program involves a different kind ol physical labor than walking and talking; lasting among the academic, religious, and at-large communities must be emphasized to parallel the economic demonstrations against the war. A fast coinciding with rallies and other protests will once again force the nation to confront its casualty figures and to recognize that while talks continue, while Vietnamization being tested, thousands of Americans and Vietnamese are needlessly dying. National and local groups are asking that participants in the Fast donate the money they would have spent on food during those three days to a fund which will go to the Vietnamese and American victims of war - Vietnamese civilian relict agencies and American anti-poverty groups. Participate in one or both tortus of protest; urge your friends and neighbors to consider the facts and join you. Fasting or tally ing as a taxpayer are alternative and different priorities, but they both emphasize the same thing: the need for a better quality of life and the alienation of suffering. *****"

About one hundred people gathered in Cushing dining room Tuesday night. One quarter of them were black. The atmosphere was tense, and all eyes followed a group of black girls as they walked through the room and sat down. At one point, a black girl mentitioned that if they would have to live in a white dorm next year, the administration ""had better add on to Baldwin"" as well. Each girl. te or black, thought of herself as hospitalized in Baldwin, not putting someone else there. The racial situation upon this campus is shaky, at best. We of the Misc. feel that the administration and trustees have succeeded in making it explosive by once again mishandling a crisis. Whites are angered mostly as a result of surprise and lack ot information...rumours that the blacks ""demanded"" Cushing (supposedly one of the best dorms on campus, certainly the most difficult to be transferred to) and got it immediately, gave rise to protest against ""powerplays"" and black ""arrogance."" Blacks were angered by what they view as the same old ""talk, talk, talk, and no action"" that they have experienced for at least the past year. One fact remains: The black girls wish to room separately, and ""off-campus."" The white students support their demand. Mrs. Drouihlet and Mr. Duggan, whose job is to ""carry out the policy ol the trustees"" (the trustees who don't live here and don't know the situation first hand) say they can do nothing, that the trustees must decide. But how can the trustees decide on something they don't live with? None of them are black, none of them are students, none of them will have to live next year with the tension of the Cushing situation. It is imperative that the trustees respond to the most recent Cushing resolution and come to Vassar before the twentieth ot this month, and imperative that they talk to students rather than to each other. It is also imperative that they decide to give the students what they decide is best for their own housing, if Vassar, at least Cushing. is to remain a livable place. Mrs. Drouihlet and Mr. Duggan invoked the law and HEW as justification for not giving Kendrick to the blacks. Yet, it would seem, that one all black corridor, or one all black half of a house is just as illegal as an entirely black house. If the administration is going to choose violations, then why don't they choose one which will prove of some benefit to the college community? On the other hand, why is it a violation for Kendrick to be all black, and not tor Davison to be all white (as it is this year)? No blacks chose to he in Davison. Well, what if no whites choose to be in Kendrick? But the school has to put the freshmen somewhere, and cannot contrive to assign them to Kendrick. either by informing them that Kendrick is an all black house, and letting them choose, or by simply putting them there. But what if students, particularly welcomers. or an informal committee, just happened to mention in their letters that the only people who had chosen Kendrick were black, and the school adopted a policy of giving freshmen their requests, at least as far as possible? If the administration really wants to solve this problem to the assent of all concerned, they still can find a way. Once again, of course, there has been no communication between the administration and the students. We have attacked this failure repeatedly in Misc. editorials. Before, perhaps, we were ready to agree that it must have been a mistake, and accepted their apologies. But no more - if the admininstration expects the faith ot the students, it will have to show itself worthy of that faith. A revolutionary situation is one in which the government loses the trust and respect of those governed, and its policies become no longer acceptable. After this debacle, perhaps a few of us. at least. are ""closer to that attitude than ever before. *****"

BY LYNNE PECK AND JESSIE NORD

Editor's Note: Lynne Peck is Executive Editor of the Misc and is not responsible for other material which appears in the supplement.

The power to hire, rehire, promote, and dismiss faculty members seems to be passed along from hand to hand, committee to committee, to rest at last in the hands of one man, the President. There are various strong influences along the way, notably the Dean of Faculty, the Advisory Committee, the department chairman and senior members, and the Trustee Committee on Faculty and studies. This complex hierarchical arrangement makes it difficult to pin down a decision to this committee or that individual, and makes it unfair to place total responsibdity for a decision, good or bad, on the President. Numerous intertwined considerations are weighed before final decisions are passed. Some of these factors include scholarly study, teaching ability (thus far judged only indirectly and by hearsay), and that crucial but officially unacknowledged factor, the compatibility of the candidate's personality and ideas with those of his fellow department members, particularly the senior members. Each instance of hiring, firing, or promotion is unique in respect to these factors, and it is difficult to pinpoint a singlesimple reason why one person was dismissed whde another was granted tenure. The explanation handed the candidate, especially if it means dismissal, is usually unspecific, unsatisfactory, and irreversible. Reasons for dismissal or for withholding of promotion are not made officially public, ostensibly because of the embarrassment it would cause the teacher. This vaguely accusing and suspicious seeretiveness contributes, however, to various extreme reactions on the part of dismissed faculty members and to an attitude of distrust in the community as a whole. People who have found themselves trapped by this strange machinery often react defensively, or with bewilderment, or with justifiable resentment towards the interdepartmental politics that, unfortunately, occasionally plays too large a part in dismissal procedure. As the irreversibdity of the decision becomes apparent, the teacher may retreat into cynical or paranoiac passivity for the rest of the year, or he may devote much of his remaining time at Vassar to criticizing outspokenly the system which is expelling him. The dismissal of several admired - and often vocal - faculty members has prompted concerned students and faculty to examine the imbalances within the system and has also brought to light the complexity of the procedures which must be analyzed to understand the decisions. President Simpson explained the recent criticism of hiring and firing procedures. ""There is always some dissatisfaction at this time because it is the time of recruiting, promotions, and dismissals. Terminations are not announced to avoid possible humiliation, but there may be ruffled feathers and the usual annual discontents."" After reiterating that each case and decision on hiring and firing is very different, he attempted to give three general reasons a faculty member might not be rehired. In the first instance, a department may unanimously decide to dismiss a faculty member. Despite presidential powers to veto appointments and reappointments, Mr. Simpson cannot insist that a department retain a member. He and the Advisory Committee may probe more deeply and question the department's

recommendation but ultimately must respect their decision. A second instance might occur when a faculty member is dissatisfied with his present position or salary but wishes to remain at Vassar. He may be offered a better position from another school, thus making it necessary to decide whether Vassar can match the offer as an incentive to stay. The department may recommend that this be done, but, as in all cases, the President and Trustees make the final decision to retain him or to ""congratulate the person on his new appointment and send him on his way."" A third possibility is that a department may recommend promotion to associate professor accompanied by a grant of tenure. Members of the Advisory Committee, the Dean of Faculty, or the President may oppose a grant of tenure if they do not feel the candidate offers enough to justify promising him a permanent position. Vassar follows an ""up-or-out"" policy by which faculty members are dismissed if for some reason they do not receive a promotion within a certain number of years, the procedure for promotion follows these general lines. Instructors, appointed annually, are generally limited to four terms. They must then either be promoted to the rank of assistant professor or dismissed. The Ph.D. ""union card"" or comparable academic achievement is a vital condition for the three-year appointment to this position. A second three-year term is usually offered, if, as Mr. Simpson said, the person is ""an acceptable teacher-scholar."" At the end of the fifth year as assistant professor, the teacher is again evaluated and is either promoted to associate professor and granted tenure, or is dismissed. A person hired as an assistant professor may not be given tenure immediately. Miss Tait recalled that the faculty pressed for this ""up-or-out"" policy because many used to remain at Vassar for long periods without knowing when or if they would ever be considered for tenure. The system is, of course, unsatisfactory for the faculty member who is dismissed because he has reached the limit of his untenured appointments, particularly if he believes he deserves tenure or continued employment. The frequent, expected re-evaluations supposedly insure academic and teaching excellence, at least untd the faculty member obtains the security of tenure. Unfortunately, they also may force the junior member to conform to certain narrow personal patterns established by senior members, or they may pressure him to place priority on publication, so helpful in courting promotion, at the expense of class preparation. From the three possibilities outlined by President Simpson, it can be supposed that the cases of Lee Devin and William Krossner exemplify the first two instances respectively.

Devin

The time of great indignation over the Devin case is passed, but the feeling of frustration on the part of many students and faculty smolders on. When it was first learned that the senior departmental members had decided that the assistant professor of drama's contract not be renewed, among the expressions of protest was a portfolio, compiled mainly by students, of letters from his present and past pupils, praising his teaching and directing techniques and his refreshing.

unorthodox view of his subject. Unfortunately, Devin and the senior members of his department conflicted on basic educational and theatrical philosophies. A larger department might have fostered less rigidity and senior unanimity in policies, but personality and academic conflicts made working conditions in the ""tight-little-island"" atmosphere of the Drama department impossible. Mr. Devin, now recovered from the shock of dismissal (""It was the first time I had been fired."") and excited about a new job as Associate Professor of English Literature and Director of the Theater at Swarthmore, has accepted the situation as inevitable. Devin was hired at Vassar by a former chairman of the department, who has since left. He began to feel the pressure of changing attitudes when he encountered difficulty in receiving a promised promotion from instructor to assistant professor following completion of his Ph.D. three years ago. His dismissal was not based on lack of publication because since his dissertation he has written several plays. He is, in fact, the second most active publisher in the department. During the interview, he explained, ""academic freedom isn't exactly the problem;"" instead, ""one against three (senior members) is no way to run a railroad - one must leave for the sanity of all. In a department that small you can ask Junior to judge by your values or leave."" Although he was fired, he found this no impediment in seeking other employment. He received best wishes from all except his department, and""the President was most helpful."" In fact, he said, now that I'm over being so insulted and angry, 1 can see that it's not a big deal that I was fired. The person whose position I took at Vassar left because he was not promoted. The schools at which I applied for a place did not contact the department. Swarthmore only contacted the President as a regular procedural check. I didn't even want departmental recommendations, because I didn't want them to lie.""

Krossner

William Krossner. who has been an assistant professor of psychology for five years, has accepted a new and better-paying position at Ford ham for next year. Hestated that he has ""enjoyed the students here."" and his ""congenial, professionally active colleagues,"" but ""I saw no future here, so I will leave."" Krossner's teaching and academic records are outstanding. Students rate him highly and he teaches a number of courses. Since receiving his Ph.D. from Harvard five years ago, he has published four scholarly articles, presented a paper to a meeting of the American Psychology Association, and will publish a textbook on psychological statistics in May. Despite these credentials, as well as recommendations from his department, it was decided that Mr. Krossner could not be granted a promotion and tenure this year. Whether or not he would have received tenure had he waited the established length of time, no one can say. The uncertainty of waiting that extra year or two has precipitated more than one departure or dismissal. Krossner could not wait for that decision to come, so he accepted the place at Eordhani. He states that he tools ""nothing but contempt for the administration and the President

for overriding departmental recommendations in promotions."" These two men may or may not exemplify two of the types of cases mentioned by the President. Whether or not they do, many students anu faculty agree that Fordham's and Swarthmore's gains are definitely Vassar's loss. Each man takes with him disappointment or anger, and in each instance, faculty and students raise critical questions which cannot be simply dismissed as ""annual discontents."" Mr. Krossner cited four basicissues and weaknesses in the present system of hiring, promotions, and dismissal. His experience may well have biased his view, but it is noteworthy that another faculty member, who wished to remain anonymous, expressed his own criticisms in identical terms.

faculty

The four basic issues Mr. Krossner and the other teacher named focus on (1) the lack of departmental autonomy; (2) the lack of due process of appeal on a decision; (3) the lack of formal student participation in hiring and firing procedures; and (4) the emphasis on publication instead of teaching ability. Mr. Krossner claimed that ""departmental recommendations have no weight with the administration"" which, he says, ""has reversed so many recommendations and has demonstrated a long history of not listening to the departments."" The Board of Trustees have ""agreed in principle"" to the Tripartite Statement, which says that except in unusual circumstances departmental judgements should be considered binding. Both Mr. Krossner and the other faculty member believe the vague working of the statement and the ""agreement in principle"" phrase have allowed the decision-makers to avoid these principles in many cases. Besides the lack of departmental autonomy, the two faculty members maintain that there is little faculty autonomy in the judgment of their peers' ability. Krossner believes that in essence ""the administration is not answerable to anyone, even departmental chairmen."" and that decisions, particularly on dismissals, are ""summary, arbitrary, and without recourse to appeal."" Some teachers criticize the lack of any real representation of junior faculty in the h iring-firing-pro motion procedures. Untenured faculty, the group most often affected by such decisions, are, according to the Governance, ineligible for election to the Advisory Committee, the main faculty representatives in such matters. Earlier this year a group of faculty members proposed a change in the Governance which they believed would be an important and needed step t 0 w a r d s departmental autonomy. This amendment, known as the Schalk Proposal, required a two-thirds majority to pass but was defeated in a vote of 71-30 with two abstentions. The amendment called for the replacement of the Advisory Committee by a Committee on Faculty Appointments. This committee of six faculty members would include two junior faculty members. Departmental recommendations on hiring, rehiring, promotions, granting of tenure, and dismissal would be regarded as binding unless the President submitted objections within six weeks. In the event of Presidential objection!, the committM itself would make the final decision. The candidate or departmental

chairman could request an appeal hearing before the Committee took final action. At that time the faculty member would have the opportunity to present any materials or witnesses he deems relevant to his appeal. In a memorandum sent to the faculty members before the vote on the Schalk Proposal, the backers of the revision stated, ""We are persuaded that our legislation, if passed, would substantially and rapidly improve not only the morale but the quality of the faculty."" Mr. David Schalk, associate professor of history, expressed ""disappointment at the results"" of the vote. He said, ""The faculty is not ready for the autonomy yet, but it wdl come in time, I believe. Right now they are not willing to take care of their own destiny and prefer administrative decisions."" Mr. Schalk discussed opponents' claims that the bdl would create too much departmental autonomy. ""It depends on one's view of human nature. The proposal was based on the optimistic belief that we are able to judge our professional peers. If a department knows that its choices will probably be binding, it will be forced to use its best judgment."" He explained that he believes in the idea that if a group is given responsibdity, it wdl act and be forced to act more responsibly. Thus, a department chairman, with enhanced powers, would not frivolously bestow promotions and reappointments which could harm the school budget. In addition, the faculty committee would be a further and final check on the decisions. By indicating confidence in the faculty's good judgment, such a system, Mr. Schalk believes, would improve faculty morale. Its comparative openness might help alleviate spring appointment-time paranoia as well. Miss Tait, Mr. Mace, and President Simpson upheld the present system for the same reason others criticize it: it checks departmental autonomy. They particularly praised the amendment to the Governance which was passed instead of the Schalk Proposal. Naturally, the two people who have served on the Advisory Committee believe in the virtues of that body. Miss Tait explained that recommendations from different departments vary widely. The Advisory Committee, the Dean of Faculty, and the President must judge from the recommendations which ones are made sincerely, and which ones are ''token gestures"" made half-heartedly to protect the feelings of the candidate. ""The Advisory Committee, on behalf of the whole faculty, gets a sense of the spectrum of activity in the various academic fields and who the candidates are."" By dint of this total view, the committee members believe they at times may justly oppose department recommendations. Miss Tait opposed the Schalk amendment because ""as a member of the faculty 1 know of the great professional jealousy and the number of cliques with their greatest locus in the departments. The whole faculty ought to guard against itself and its weaknesses."" Mr. Mace enlarged on this problem, saying that the departments should determine their own membership but should not be left entirely without an outside check. Otherwise they could weaken themselves because factionalism in the departments, especially smaller ones, would leave little room for healthy intellectual competition or variety. Miss Tait also stated that decisions about Ihe granting of tenure are most difficult because it must be ascertained that ""that poison is the best person to fill Ihe tenured slot.

Protest activities continue against the consortium. Students have circulated a petition requesting the Trustees to return to the campus for discussion with the students. The petition reads: ""In light of the emphatic stand which the Vassar student body has taken on the current issue of the Consortium, evidenced by the February 15th student referendum and the February 17th Senate resolutions, we the undersigned, hereby request that the Board of Trustees of Vassar College meet on campus with concerned members of the Vassar community at the earliest opportunity in the coming week of February 22nd."" A group of students carry on with actions boycotting Vassar. These actions include contacting alumnae and alumni to express opposition to the consortium and to ask them to withhold funds until the consortium is repealed, collecting signatures on petitions from Seniors refusing to make class donations or later donations if the consortium is enacted, and contacting prospective and incoming students to explain the protest against the consortium To demonstrate opposition to IBM's involvement in the consortium leafletting in the comunity about IBM and teach-ins on the corporation are planned Some students plan to attend the Mixer dressed as business men complete with attache cases. During band breaks they will entertain with dancing and singing IBM family songs. Next week two members of the Seattle Conspiracy including Joe Kelly, plan to speak on campus. They will discuss current campus affairs, the Seattle Conspiracy, the war in Laos, national student spring actions, and particularly the National Student Association proposed People's Peace Treaty.

Vassar,The Miscellany News,Letter on consequences of witholding alumni donations,https://newspaperarchives.vassar.edu/?a=d&d=miscellany19710226-01.2.7&srpos=22&e=-12-1969--01-1986--en-20-miscellany-21-byDA-txt-txIN-protest-------,1971-02-26,,,entire student body,Consortium between Vassar and IMB,IMB's involvement in the war,"anti-war, Vietnam war, divestment, IMB",administration,"students, alumni",,,witholding donations,Vassar College,Yes,vc_imbconsortium,"Alumnae Letter

Certain groups on this campus have decided that the most expedient way to protest the Vassar /consortium relationship is to contact the alumnae and urge them to withhold donations to the college. This rationale is perversely effective - it hits Vassar in the pocketbook, the most vulnerable spot. However, as a form of protest this tactic engenders more disadvantages than advantages. Vassar desperately needs money; to eliminate a substantial amount of alumnae funding would be disastrous. Since the majority of the donations would probably be channeled into sundry educational areas - for improved facilities, lectures, new teachers, building expansions, and scholarships - it seems obvious that to withhold funds would damage the future for the entire college and its community, not simply the graduate center. Some of the students who signed the letter being sent to alumnae are on Vassar scholarships or Financial Aid grants. Are they asking Vassar College to stop supporting their education here? The Misc agrees with those students who feel that the alumnae should express their opinions - negative or otherwise - to the college about the graduate center; we disagree, however, about the method of expression. Mother's advice about not cutting off your nose to spite your face seems apt; losing alumnae funds would only succeed in entrenching Vassar in a continual financial crisis, a continual cycle of undesirable educational cutbacks. An alumnae letter - pro or con - can produce constructive effects: a cessation of donations can only hurt the caliber and potential of a Vassar education."

President Simpson has for a second time tried to discredit student opinion on Vassar's involvement in a graduate center, by telling the media that student opinion is the result of ""mental reflex action"" (as the Poughkeepsie Journal calls it) rather than of logic. The Journal's editorial of February 26, ""Decision by Reflex,"" clearly takes its position from President Simpson's interpretation of events at Vassar. ""Alan Simpson, president of Vassar College, alluded to this mental reflex action in his statement concerning student attitudes toward the controversial graduate center..."" President Simpson seems to believe that students who voted ""no"" on the consortium did not hold considered opinions at all, but were motivated by a number . of unworthy factors, or else were merely confused. He is quoted as saying that the pr6test movement was getting ""less and less sympathy from the majority."" But the ""protest movement"" is the majority. Perhaps President Simpson would like it believed that the protest movement is made up of a handful of hard-core irrationalists, and that the rest of the student body - the ""Majority"" who voted down the

consortium - swung behindlthem out of ignorance or passMty 01 something on that order. If If anyone is guilty of wjhat Journal calls ""reflex thin|dng'/ltV = is President Simpson himpplfflnd J5 a few other supporters oy/the consortium. Clearly he /fther believes, or has attempted to create the belief, that student opinion must be discounted. Having committed himsrfW to the h

consortium, he seems to be trying to find ways of minimizing or ignoring the strong opposition that exists at Vassar. In the two referenda, student response was not to his liking, so President Simpson sought to undermine the significance of the vote. The result of the first referendum was ""irrational:"" the result of the second, not ""reliable."" On the basis of President Simpson's past performance, there is strong reason to believe that if the entire student body were to vote down the consortium again tomorrow, he would find some reason for dismissing that vote as well. President Simpson has shown that he himself acts in terms of ""mental reflex action;"" this seems perfectly to describe the pronouncements on student opinion he has made to date. If anyone is impervious to logic, it is Simpson himself. And here is an exercise for everyone's reasoning processes: We have been told that IBM will not ""control"" the Consortium. We have also been told that the consortium will come into being, with or without Vassar's participation. If we ask ourselves whether the consortium would come into being with or without IBM's support, some interesting implications are revealed. If IBM were not going to supply 85'< of the students, and their tuition, would the consortium go ahead nevertheless? Would Syracuse, Union, and Vassar build a ""modest little building"" for themselves alone? It seems unlikely. Without Vassar, the show goes on; without IBM, it is icatcti) conceivable. This suggests .1 true idea of whose power is greatest, and whose interests will be most strongly represented. Whether or not IBM is one of the founding members of the consortium, it is obviousK going to be the most powerful one."

We could argue the pros and cons of the current system of evaluating faculty members, of student demands, of any and all degrees of modification in the middle endlessly, and make little progress. When students said at Wednesday's meeting that they did not want to hear ""rules and regulations,"" that is exactly what they meant. The protest to some extent goes beyond Vassar, beyond hiring and firing practices here. Implicitly with the principles behind the demands and explicitly with the sit-in, is a challenge to educational goals and policies here, but also a questioning of those values in society. I know that is vague and clicheish - but I really do not know how else to say it. I do not necessarily agree with all the demands of the students, although I think substantial change in the faculty evaluative system is essential. Even if I did agree with the demands I would not agree with the tactics of a sit-in, and I think the students should leave - for their own good and for the good of this college. I hate to use the word ""frustration,"" and to administrative questions of how do we deal with ""vague and pervasive discontent"" I offer no answers. But it is not a matter of agreeing with what is often termed as ""emotionalism,"" if rules and laws are not to be dealt with - it is a matter of looking deeply into the reasons why it seems to be so influential among students to the extent that ""rational"" voices, particularly among students themselves, are largely unheard and even ridiculed. We are attempting communication on different levels and the presentation of demands and specific proposals for change by students seem only to confuse the issue. Students present them and then apparently refuse to negotiate them or act in a way which will allow change to be implemented. Administrative and much faculty reaction is anger, the impuls a is to punish the offending children, but how much are they willing to look into the reasons why many people who I am sure have spent much effort at ""rational"" thought turn to such drastic and, to the administration and to some faculty, inexplicable methods? I really think the sit-in has served, but now outlived its purpose. No matter what happens now, if governance is revised or if it is not, I do not know what might stop this elusive but powerful frustration from taking hold again - in a slightly different form, for a slightly different reason, but it will be just as elusive and probably just as powerful. As I say, I offer no answers. Society, education, and Vassar will not become perfect tomorrow - and even if they did for some people they would not for others. I do not mean to minimize the specific complaints which students have with Vassar College. The grievances are real, and Vassar is not just the focus of all this ""frustration"" but here and now it is the cause. At this time it is impossible for me to attempt an analysis of ways in which Vassar should change its governance with respect to contract decisions, although maybe that would be the only way to draw the attention to all that precipitated the protest to begin with. But there is still a chance that something positive can come out of this and we should all try to assure that. The first thing for the students to do is leave Main."

Distrust

by JUDY YANDOH

To view the sit-in only in the terms of an action to improve education at Vassar is to misinterpret the full meaning of the protest. The occupation of the North Wing of Main is a reaction by students to the belief that the administration will not take into consideration their opinions unless there is direct action. The sit-in is a reflection of a deep distrust in President Simpson. It could be argued that all channels for Governance revision were not exhausted before the action was taken. Yet it must also be remembered that the administration has lately set no precedent in taking into serious account student opinion (especially on the Consortium) or issues of vital concern to the college community. Vassar can function only if students believe that their opinions will be considered without a section of Main being taken over. Compromise is required by both the students and the administration. I would suggest that the sit-in be ended now, that no student involved be punished, and that an immediate revision of the Governance by the new faculty-student committee be initiated. The sit-in also raises the question of the protestors responsibility to the rest of the student body, especially in regard to the shutting down of the services of the Deans' offices. One of last week's Misc editorials contained the statement, ""That while they (the Committee on Faculty Firing) welcome the support of the uncommitted, their disapproval or disavowal will not affect the former's action."" Such a cavalier attitude toward student reaction seems incongruous with the committee's stated attempt to be acting for the benefit of the college community. Most students have grown apathetic about the sit-in; the occupation of North Wing has become an accepted part of the Vassar scene in much the same sense the Retreat has. But further radical action to force the hand of the administration could conceivably result in the active resistance by the majority of students to the moves of the Committee."

Thoughts on the April Sit-In

by ANN MENASCHE

Around midnight of April 21 of 1971200 Vassar students occupied the North wing of Main in protest over the arbitrary firing of a few faculty members, many of whom were popular teachers and received good departmental recommendations. This came after several weeks during which students exhausted so-called •legitimate channels"", including holding a mass meeting where President Simpson and members Of the Faculty Advisory Committee who give recommendations on hiring and firing to Simpson, who generally speaking had the final say) refused to answer students' questions on the reasons these teachers were fired, and obtaining overwhelming Senate support for the demands of the students. The conflict over hiring and firing pinpointed the bierachical structure of Vassar College, which like other colleges and universities in America, denies students and faculty any significant decision making power in running the College Power, as Mr. Simpson clearly stated to me in a meeting last week, lies ultimately in the Trustees, made up of people like the Vice President of IBM and the former head of Central Hudson. They delegate authority to the President, whom they appoint and may revoke. Tenure, though in one sense the only job protection teachers have since they have neither a union nor any power within the college structure, sets up a hierachy of privileges in the faculty and tends to stagnate it with older, more traditional teachers iwho think like the President I, discouraging the more creative, radical or unconventional ones 'This society, which calls inself democratic, shows its hypocrisy when it denies the members of a college community (students and faculty i the power to control that community. But this denial of simple democratic rights is necessary for capitalism to survive. since capitalism depends on universities (and all other institutions such as businesses and government) to he run by and in the interest of the ruling class and the bureaucrats right under them, instead of by and in the interests of the majority of the people Mr Simpson told me when we spoke that many people in the Sit-in didn't realize how radical and

extreme our demands really were This is understandable since democracy Beamed quite moderate and unreasonable to us; at least we had always been taught that it was But our demands did not even carry democracy to its logical con elusion by demanding oneperson. one vote, or even a representative council composed of half faculty and half students. We only demanded that a Committee of Faculty Appointments be set up composed of three tenured members of the faculty, three non-tenured members, bot'i elected from the faculty as a whole, and three student members elected from the student body, and that this Committee be given final say in hiring and firing. Still, the college did not even grant us this. But does this mean that the Sitin and the struggle for studentfaculty control is a waste of time, since we won't win our demands in totality until after a Socialist Revolution? Definitely not. The demand for student-faculty control takes a transitional character, meaning that we CAN win significant concessions and gains from the schools before a Revolution through mass struggle and at the same time our struggles will point out more and more clearly the need for revolutionary change. We must keep in mind that we would not have even won an expanded student) review apparatus, the Student Advisory Committee,'as provided for in the Committee of 7"" report, had it not been for the Sit-in. Even though Mr Simpson admitted that the ""CommitteeOf 7"" Report makes no change whatsoever in ths power structure of the College, it does allow students to rev lew faculty members who are being considered for tenure and make a recommendation (only a recommendation, of course) The Sit-In won as this minor victory. hut if we had done things right. we could have won more and avoided getting $100 fines and ""suspended expulsions"". First of all. even though we involved more than two hundred students, we would have been much more effective if we had involved more students. A mass student strike similtanoous with a Sit In would have put much more pressure on the college to really negotiate and would have prevented the Sit In from evolving into a small elite group

isolated from the rest of the students 'There is a physical limit on how many people can take active part in the Sit-in Obviously, it is much more dif lieult to mobilize the entire student body into action, but there are precedents, even at Vassar 'The greatest measure of student faculty control Vassar ever had was during the May 1970 National Student Strike, when Vassar was turned into an AntiWar mobilizing center to reach out to the rest of the population. A steering committee was elected and major decisions were made at open mass meetings And again, last year, there was a fairly successful one day strike over VIT iVIT seems dead now, partly thanks to us) If we had taken over a more crucial part of Vassar like the Post Office or the Computer Center, we would have put more pressure on the administration also. But unless we had the mass support and participation that something like a simultaneous strike would provide, such an action might have opened us to more victimization than we experienced with the taking over of the North Wing of Main. On May 5. we evacuated the building, announcing that we were leaving ""on trust"", a ""trust"" supposedly arising from the Committee of 7 report In truth, it was near the end of the school year and people had papers and exams But it was a great mistake to leave the sit-in saying that we trusted those who had so betrayed us in the past and not even demand amnesty. Our trust was rewarded with indictments After a two week sit m. we left like fools At that point it would have been worth it to stay a little longer until we were at least granted amnesty (Amnesty should have been part ot the initial demands). We should have made it clear from the beginning that in the struggle over (acuity firings, we were the victims and the administration the criminals, and that we did not deserve to be punsihed. In capitalist society, the only morality is that of victory, the winner is rewarded and the k set is punished Mr Simpson sue ceeded in waiting us out until we left on our own accord We lost mi the main) and were punished. Next tune we will avoid the mistakes that we made last spring and win"

To the Editor: We, a group of concerned Black students at Vassar College wish to express what we determine as an outrage to the public and in particular to Black people. We are concerned about the education of people to the elements of our society which contribute to our polarization and continued practices to promote ignorance of true facts. Senator John Dunne of New York State spoke supposedly on ""Attica "" He hardly touched the tragedy but dealt in what we feel was a blatant misrepresentation of his purpose and the facts. We protest the following aspects of his presentation: 1 A lack of sensitivity toward the situation at Attica, minorities and their problems 2 His superficial approach to his subject and manner in relating his subject. 3. His constant politicking throughout his speech 4 His evasive manner His lack of sensitivity was displayed in the following manner. His jocular opening Statements about us being nice

Vassar girls and a whole tirade of his adventures at Vale as it related to Vassar. This manner was displayed throughout his speech, even when discussing tragic events. His sensitivity was lacking in the fact that he constantly referred to tin' prisoners as ""chaps"" or by their first names and referred to the officials and guards as ""Mr "" or their title. His preconceived notion of the actions of the prisoners when he assumed that the white bandages around the slain hostages throats were the result of their throats having been slashed. He constantly passed value judgements on the actions and reaction of the prisoners, their organizational abilities, the noncommitment of Brother Bobby Scale to sell his Brothers a compromise package and his lack of any emotion or remorse when describing the scene he witnessed when the prison was under seige resulting in the death of the inmates and guards The crowning statement was his referral to himself when he found himself inside Attica was, ""What's a nice middle class white boy like me doing in a place like this?"" His superficiality was displayed by the constant name dropping of Black and Puerto Rican members of the negotiating team in order to

qualify his image as a ""liberal"" with a rapport with the minorities He constantly used terms that would identify him on the same level as the minorities; ""Brothers. T's in the ghetto."" He described the physical structure of the prison, its ar chitecture and its fine programs Yet these very programs were the ones the prisoners wished to reform This lends questions as to the credibility and sincerity of Mr Dunne as a member of the negotiating team, especially since he was against amnesty, a key issue. His politicking took several forms He claimed that he was received more openly and warmly by the prisoners than any other member of the negotiating team He kept stressing that there were no votes in prison, therefore, trying to justify his humanitarianism He was constantly asking for support for his program which he never fully outlined in concrete terms, as to what approach we should take that would be meaningful towards reform. He implored us to go into the prison and speak with the inmates yet ignoring the true factors that need reform, the guards, the officials and the systems His referral to

Rockefeller calling him ""Johnny"" was strictly a political maneuver to enhance his credibility as a good in "" A politician who can make waves He displayed the true politician's art of evasion in the question and answer period When people started getting into the ""gut"" issues on the moral it) ot what happened at Attica, he answered in the most evasive and superficial way and terminated tiie question and answer period The whole presentation of Mr Dunne was an insult to the in telligence of any logical, politically aware individual in the audience What price will we have to pay in the cause for prison reform if an individual of his qualifications is assigned as the leader of the vanguard for the prison reform It is up to all thinking and aware individuals to expose the John Dunnes who would lead us down the primrose path to frustration and disillusionment He is nothing more than an extension of the repressive forces in our government who choose ""lackeys"" to whitewash the real and the ugly in order to restore and maintain the public image of a democratic, just, central government"

Victoria Strauss ""77 Carroll E. Robertoon'79

To the Editor: While we are not members of the Coalition for Social Responsibility, and have not participated in any of their actions or protests, we fully support their right to protest - and, in general, the right to protest against anything one considers morally indefensible - within reasonable and non-destructive bounds. We realize that the Coalition itself was not responsible for the offensive and irresponsible graffiti which recently appeared on Vassar buildings, walkways and bulletin boards; moving against consensus within the Coalition, several Coalition members unilaterally decided to indulge their need for ""free expression,""

thereby seriously damaging the credibility of the Coalition as a whole. The Coalition has called these members to account for their actions, and has attempted to remove the slogans. The Coalition has not only manifested its protest in a reasonable and dignified manner, but through its protest it has created constructive alternatives and achieved positive results. We wish, however, to register our shock and dismay at the general conservatism of the student body, revealed over and over in private conversations, and now publicly in the letter by Mr. Shillinglaw (Misc. 10-27-78). In effect, he holds that students should not utilize the effective tactics of non-violent con-

frontation in their protest; because this is inconvenient to others. This is an extremely depressing attitude: it is indicative of the most damaging sort of escapist conservatism, a refusal to consider anything that obtrudes into the normal established routine. To say that the Coalition's protest is ""essentially...just and wellmeant"" but that its manifestation as public confrontation is ""counter-productive"" is to relegate protest to the private sphere of thought, conversation, and the occasional letter. This is a hypocritical attitude, for to deny protest the right to actively and publicly confront its opposition is to deny protest the right to protest. The public arena is protest's most productive forum; this has been demonstrated time and time again. In effect, Mr. Shillinglaw wants to keep protest under wraps. In this he - and the ""silent majority"" he seems to believe he represents - mirror the attitudes of an increasingly conservative society and its wish to ignore anything that visibly conflicts with the established status quo. This is especially frightening when one realizes that Mr. Shillinglaw's silent majority is the next generation, the generation that will graduate to law, business, and medical schools, to the controlling positions of society; and these people will overwhelm, by their deafening silence, public displays of free speech and moral sen-

sibility."

By MARGO HASSELMAN Staff Writer

A massive rally will be held on campus tomorrow, April 8, at 3 p.m. The rally will protest the congressional bill HR4, ""The Personal Responsibility Act.""

The act, which recently passed the House of Representatives and currently is being debated in the Senate will attempt to curb government spending by cutting social welfare programs like Aid to Families with Dependent Children, lowering funding for nutrition programs, and denying access to welfare to large groups of people. The Act is a pivotal part of the ""Contract with America,"" which presently is receiving massive media and popular attention. The rally, to be held on Josselyn Beach, is an outgrowth of the recent Seven College Conference on Women and Welfare that was held at Vassar last month. Each of the ""Seven Sisters"" colleges, which include Wellesley, Mount Holyoke, Barnard, Smith, Bryn Mawr, and Radcliffe (along with Vassar), will hold a rally or ""teachin"" between the Bth and 15th of April. The rallies and ""teach-ins"" are collectively known as the ""Seven College Protest,"" and are the brainchild of Women's Studies major Rachel Simmons '96, who has focused on welfare for much of her time at Vassar. Graduates of the Seven Sisters were crucial to forming the welfare state, and historically have been leaders in student activism and in placing progressive pressures on government. ""I look upon them as our intellectual ancestors,"" said Simmons, stressing the primary theme, as she sees it, of Saturday's rally. ""It is incumbent on us in the 1990's to continue their tradition of

leadership and activism."" She and the coordinators of the protests at the other schools hope that collective action among all seven colleges will help legitimize the protests through the colleges' historical significance as the first schools in the country to educate women, and through the fact that the protest is an outgrowth of an educational conference. The conference, Simmons believes, shows that welfare is both an intellectually and sociologically important issue. Simmons hopes that the protests will spark another wave of student activism and political awareness. Student activism ""has been on life support for a generation,"" she commented, ""and in this time of political crisis it is crucial for students to remobilize as a strong political force in this country."" She sees a ""resuscitation of student activism"" as the second theme of the rally. Student activism is particularly vital to the issue of welfare, because, according to the protest's community involvement committee chair Jenny Bender '96, ""Most of the people who will be most affected by these changes don't have the privilege to step forward and take responsibility. They can't put their names up front because they're already so threatened."" Community involvement is the third and most important theme of the rally to Simmons and Bender. Community support for the protest has been ""overwhelming,"" according to Simmons, with approximately twenty Dutchess County organizations officially endorsing and publicizing the gathering. Among the group supporting and participating in the rally are the Mid-Hudson branch of the National Organization for Women, the National Association for the Advancement of Col-

ored People, welfare organizations like Dutchess Outreach, the Civil Service Employee's Association, various religious groups, several colleges and otherschools, and additional groups focused on women, children, and low-income families. The rally ""will be an important vehicle for breaking down the barriers between Vassar College and Poughkeepsie,"" said Bender. Both Bender and Simmons have worked to break those barriers since coming to Vassar, and believe involving the community as much as possible in this protest will be an important step toward better town-col lege relations. ""This rally is not for the community but with it,"" said Bender, who is eager to shed Vassar's elitist image. To help facilitate community involvement, there will be shuttles running from the other schools in the county as well as from locations in Poughkeepsie, and child care will be provided. Once the delegations from the community arc combined with attendance by Vassar students,

Simmons hopes to find 1 .OOOpeople or more crowded on Josselyn beach on Saturday to hear three keynote speakers from outside the community, including ex-assembly woman Eileen Hickey and hunger and homeless advocate Bill Ayers, as well as several speakers from the community. Letter-writing campaigns and other forms of political involvement will be accessible at the rally, and many local groups will offer information on their services as well. Simmons and Bender hope for press coverage from major newspapers, in order to help Poughkeepsie \s and Vassar's voices be heard in Washington. Simmons commented, ""I feel that this could potentially be an historical event for the Vassar campus."" She added, ""[The college] will be politicized to a greater degree than perhaps ever before,"" and she hopes that the efforts of the college will affect not only the local community, but the direction of the tide of student activism over the whole country, and the trend of social policy in Washington."

By STEPHANIE BOSCO Staff Writer

Approximately 40 students gathered in front of Strong on Sun., Apr. 21 to protest possible changes in Strong's single-sex status. The demonstration, organized by Tiffany Johnson '98, began at approximately 2:15 p.m. while many parents still remained on campus for Parents' Weekend. The students marched with signs urging the maintenance of Strong as an all-female dorm, chanting, ""Women are strong...co-ed is wrong,"" and ""R-E-S-P-E-C-T...single-sex is all for me."" They walked through Noyes Circle to ACDC where several more students joined them in protest. They then continued to march through the quad and into the library and College Center. Protestor Lisa Perreault '98 lives in Main but believed the administration, ""should keep Strong all

women."" She said, ""I think it's a change at Vassar that is really upsetting? It does not recognize the tradition and diversity of Vassar's heritage and shows the administration's lack of concern for what students want."" According to an all-campus e-mail Johnson sent to students to inform them of the protest and pending changes in Strong's status, ""The demonstration is being held in order to make it known to the Vassar administration that their disregard of the concerns, needs and wishes of Strong residents and the student body in general regarding the abolition of Strong's single-sex status is unacceptable."" According to Johnson, the demonstration was also a protest of the way Vassar was being advertised in handbooks and catalogues. According to Johnson some students are concerned about the exclusion of a listing for BiGALA in the student handbook and the way the Vassar

experience was depicted in the course catalogue. In the catalogue there is one picture of three white male baseball players in contrast to previous catalogues where, according to Johnson and other concerned students, Vassar's diversity has been more accurately reflected. Johnson, who is a resident of Raymond but feels that Strong should remain all-female, addressed Strong residents about the need for action during their room draw. According to Johnson, after writing the e-mail, she was told by Dean of Students D.B. Brown that the ""assumptions"" made in the e-mail were too broad. Johnson said she was happy with the protest because ""it did not have an angry tone. Students and parents who saw the protest got the feeling that Strong residents are happy and fun people,"" dispelling the myth of the stereotypical Strong resident. The protest gained ""a lot of energy by

itself,"" Johnson added. The possibility that Strong might go co-ed was publicized in early April. According to Director of Residential Life Faith Nichols, Strong's status will depend on the number of incoming freshmen who request to live in the only single-sex dorm. Thus Strong's possible transition to co-ed will not occur until the summer. According to an Apr. 12 article in The Miscellany News, 80 percent of Strong residents polled wish the dorm to remain single-sex. A committee has been working to promote Strong over the past few months. Strong Vice-President Piya Kochhar' 98 said of the protest: ""This was my first protest, and it was the most fun I've had in a long time. There were parents taking pictures of us, and one mother even recommended that we should protest at

Convocation."" ""Even though a lot more people said that they would show up than actually came, I think that the people who were there made their point well,"" she added. A number of students disagreed with the student protest because they feel that Strong's future should depend on whether it can attract enough students to fill its rooms. ""I don't think that a protest can show the true interest in Strong staying singlesex —that can only happen at room draw,"" commented Main President Jason Baumgarten '98. Johnson, who has received some negative and threatening feedback as a result of her efforts said, ""I think it's important, historically and traditionally, to keep Strong all-female. We must acknowledge the reason Vassar came into being. Women live there for many different reasons...reasons not being taken seriously.""

For Yom Ha Showa—the world-wide remembrance day for Holocaust victims—the Holocaust Commemeration Week Committee sponsored a reading of all of the documented names of Jews who perished in the Holocaust. The reading was held from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. in the College Center on April 16. Student volunteered to read names for 15 minute periods throughout the day.

BY SUSAN KERLINGER News Editor

The Student Activists' Union and Queer Political Action Committee held a protest on April 10 at a Cracker Barrel restaurant in Fishkill to protest what they claim are unfair discriminatory policies against homosexuals.

""In 190). Cracker Barrel instituted a policy saying that it would no longer employ people 'whose sexual preferences fail to demonstrate normal heterosexual values, which have been the foundation of families in our society,'"" said SAU Co-Chair Matt Kavanagh '01.

""We as a society have said that it is not okay to discriminate based on people's identity or ascriptive characteristics,"" said Kavanagh. ""Someone's sexual orientation is part of who they are, and it is wrong to discriminate based on that.""

""I'm sorry, [but] that does not represent Cracker Barrel in any way,"" said Cracker Barrel Corporate Communications Director Julie Davis. ""Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. does not discriminate in service or in employment opportunities because of sexual orientation.""

""Cracker Barrel claimed at one point that it has rescinded the policy,"" said Kavanagh. ""[But] now they claim no comment.""

""Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc.'s clearly stated equal employment policy is: 'Cracker Barrel is an equal opportunity employer. Cracker Barrel is committed to providing equal employment based solely on experience, aptitude and abilities. We do not

tolerate discrimination of any kind toward any individual or group,'"" said Davis. ""Cracker Barrel's policies against discrimination are clearly stated in our Employee Handbook, which is reviewed by all employees when they begin their employment."" said Davis. ""We have an open door policy in which all employees have access to report to the company any conduct they consider inappropriate."" ""Anything else you have heard about Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's policy is inaccurate,"" she said. ""The underlying issue here is that there is no federal, and in New York and 40 other states, no state protection from job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation."" said QPAC Co-Chair Sarah From '01. ""They conform to all state and federal guidelines,"" Kavanagh said. ""It's unconscionable that we allow discrimination to take place and don't have laws against it."" Before the demonstration, protesters sent the Fishkill restaurant s general manager a letter for him to sign, stating that he would not conform to discriminatory policies. The letter was not returned, and the protesters went to the restaurant Saturday morning. ""The Fishkill Cracker Barrel is a symbol of Cracker Barrel, Inc., and we want to make sure that corporate headquarters knows that if they have discriminatory practices, local restaurants will be targeted,"" said From. ""Cracker Barrel is a symbol of how lives can be ruined when a corporation exploits [the lack of legislation against discrim-

ination]."" ""Cracker Barrel takes discrimination complaints seriously, investigates, and takes prompt remedial action when necessary,"" said Davis. Protesters said that the response to their presence was mostly positive. ""The customers were definitely very interested. People stood outside and listened."" said QPAC member Josh Simmons '01. ""I think we got good reactions, especially from people driving by."" The police were called for what protesters said were false accusations. ""The police claim that customers had called because we were throwing rocks at customers, which was completely absurd,"" said Simmons. He also said that the police were very friendly to the protesters. They did not take any action

beyond cautioning them to stay on public property, according to Kavanagh.

""[lt's absurd] that someone would feel the need to fabricate that kind of claim for the cops to tell me that we definitely posed a threat to the restaurant that day.and that they wanted us out of there,"" said From. ""Ultimately. I'm sure that our action will be reported to corporate headquarters, which is exactly what we wanted to happen.""

Kavanagh said no one talked directly to the protesters, but literature was passed out. and cars driving by on Route 9 honked in support.

""We plan to present both the Fishkill Cracker Barrel and Cracker Barrel corporation with petitions demanding that they implement inclusive non-discrimination policies,"" said From. ""Also, we will

continue petitioning for SONDA. New York's Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act. and ENDA. the federal Employment Non-Discrimination Act."" According to a February, 1994. Business Week article. ""[After the change in policy] a $24 billion public pension fund the New York City Employees Retirement System, which holds one percent of Cracker Barrel's stock, pushed to get an anti-discrimination question OB the proxy ballot."" At that time, the proposal lost, but it did gain 15.6 percent ofthe votes. ""That looks like a loss, but in fact was a big win for people fighting for gay and lesbian rights,"" Simmons said. He said that the majority of voters on the board are elderly, white, upper-class businessmen, who would normally be adverse to hiring homosexual employees.

Members of SAU and QPAC protested Cracker Barrel's alleged discriminatory policies on April 10."

By SARAH HANSON News Editor

Twenty-eight Vassar students, organized by the Student Activist Union, joined I (),()()() other people Nov. 17-19 at Fort Benning in Columbus, Cja., for the annual protest against the School of the Americas, which trains Latin American soldiers in questionable warfare tactics. SOA graduates are responsible for numerous human rights violations, and Nov. 18 marks the day that six Jesuit priests were killed by former SOA students in El Salvador. ""These priests stood up against military tyranny, as we do, and their martyrdom is what the protest is shaped around,"" said Peter Owens '03. The protest is organized nationally by SOA Watch, which monitors and organizes the annual protest, has been instrumental getting SOA manuals released and publishing graduates' human rights records online (they can be seen at wwwMHtw.org). The group received funding from the VSA to attend the conference component of the protest. According to Evan White '03, who organized the trip with Melissa Quirk '01, preparations included attending nonviolence training at Bard College and info meetings on the SOA and meeting as a group to discuss logistics. After traveling by car, the group spent the night in a Unitarian sanctuary in Atlanta and then proceeded to Fort Benning in Columbus. Once on base, Owens described the procession at the beginning of the protest as ""very somber and peaceful, with the names of the SOA victims being read and raising crosses in their memory, until we started moving."" After that, he explained, many of

the younger protesters began singing and chanting. ""The older protest organizers kept telling us to maintain solemnity, but it didn't really happen, so there was an interesting split in tactics, mainly along age lines,"" he said. ""The old pacifist tactics are being phased out by the new wave of younger activists."" ""It was a much more confrontational protest this year,"" White added. ""I feel like the authorities treated people very well in the beginning, since the protest went as predicted in the beginning,"" Owens said. ""SOA Watch told the military police that they had 'nothing to fear' from protesters and that we would comply with them in every way possible

""The old pacifist tactics are being phased out.'

This ended with the puppet confrontation, when the MPs charged the protesters, broke their signs, hogticd the puppet holders and threw them over their shoulders and onto buses."" ""The Columbus police were very nice to us. The MPs were also pretty nice, but I think they were scared"" said White. A total of 17(H) protesters were arrested, but none were Vassar students

The structure of the protest was dictated by SOA Watch, which favors pacifist tactics. ""People resented that it was a choreographed protest, but [SOA Watch] made an effort to include other forms of nonviolent protest."" explained White, who was frustrated by the strict organization. ""I understand there's a history to this protest and I want to respect it. but I felt like the SOA Watch peacekeepers were too controlling."" Despite frustration with the structure of the protest. White said. ""I think everyone who went felt that it was a very valuable experience. Although this happens every year it is a really powerful event that consistently draws a huge number of people, an incredibly diverse group of people. There were old nuns and younger protesters that came together to say that the SOA can't be allowed in their names, funded by their tax dollars."" ""For me, the most amazing thing about the SOA protest is the diversity and sheer numbers of people who attend,"" said Owens. ""I felt like it was most important to bt there, make my voice heard, and add one more person to the already massive resistance."" ""One of the things I'd like to sec is that it doesn't end there,"" White said, explaining that the student protesters have plans to try and incorporate information about the SOA into the curriculum and raise awareness in the Poughkeepsie community. ""It's important to keep this in view after the protest is over"""

Vassar policy protested at hookah-in

Stephen Cheng Staff Writer

Approximately 20 students held a ""hookahin"" protest on the Library lawn on Wednesday, Oct. 11, in opposition to the College's refusal to allow the owners of the local Zorona Restaurant and Hookah Bar to establish an open-air hookah bar. Dan Schwartz '07 and Lidiya Yankovskaya '08 organized the demonstration, posting fliers around campus and creating a Facebook event called ""Zorona's Hookah-in."" Students sat in a circle and took turns smoking from various hookahs. The protest grew from one initial group to include three more within two hours. The organizers also displayed a poster board for comments and handed out copies of the 10.6.06 issue of The Miscellany News, which featured an investigation into Vassar's decision to halt Zorona's plans for the hookah bar.

""We actually wanted to do this for a little while,"" Schwartz said of the event, adding that he e-mailed various administrators to alert them to student concern over the matter. ""I know Zorona's had been preparing the bar for a long while and it seems last-minute [to end it],"" said James Eversmeyer '08, one of the protestors. ""It's something that Vassar should have taken care of before now and in a conclusive manner."" Organizers also considered starting a petition in the future. Schwartz contacted Dean of the College Judy Jackson and Vice President of Finance and Administration Elizabeth Eismeier prior to the protest to discuss the issue further. According to Schwartz, Jackson and Eismeier were both receptive to his concerns. ""I look forward to continuing the dialogue,"" Schwartz said. Zorona Restaurant management was aware of the protest, but was not associated with the demonstration. According to Schwartz, the owners ""were really happy to hear that we're supporting them.""

Vassar's history of student protests

A look at student activism on national and campus levels

7*he most recent ACT OUT protest ended with six Vassar students being arrested for their demonstration against the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" military policy. Challenging ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" is just one of the causes that Vassar students have espoused in the College's vibrant history of civil activism and student protest. While not all of these causes have involved civil disobedience for political ends, Vassar students have long since participated in national and campus-based movements to affect change. Months of Vietnam war protest in 1967 The destruction and controversy of the Vietnam War ignited activist sensibilities in Vassar students on more than one occasion. On April 12, 1967, 200 Vassar students and faculty members gathered outside of Main Building for a silent vigil to generate enthusiasm for upcoming national protests. The crowd slowly circled Main Building holding signs that expressed demands such as ""End draft—Let young men live."" The next day, a smaller faction of students who supported the moral grounds for military decisions and activities in Vietnam formed a peaceful counterprotest outside Main. Three days later, Vassar students gathered In New York City with between 100,000 and 400,000 people. Individuals at this protest included hundreds of groups and colleges, such as the Veterans for Peace in Vietnam and the Women's Strike for Peace. The crowd marched from Central Park to a rally held at the United Nations Plaza, during which eminent civil rights speakers such as Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke. On Oct. 27, 1967, 100,000 people (with 100 Vassar students in their midst), attended a Mobilization for Peace March in Washington, D.C. The march began at the Lincoln Memorial and proceeded to the Pentagon. The procession was delayed by the American Nazi Party, which met the protestors with an armed counterresistance. Chaos ensued at the Pentagon; protestors tried to break into the defense headquarters and to engage in civil disobedience outside of the building. Police subdued the protestors with arrests, beatings, and tear gas bombs, but Vassar students were unharmed by the authorities. Students arrested at Iraq War demonstrations in New York City Five Vassar seniors were arrested for their involvement in a non-violent demonstration in New York City against the death toll of the Iraq war on Aug. 31, 2004. The demonstration took place in concert with Direct Action Day, a citywide protest effort that was scheduled for the second day of the 2004 Republican Convention and led to a total of 550 activism-related arrests. The students had met in Central Park early that morning wearing black clothing and white makeup. They carried signs reading ""war dead."" Accompanied by five legal observers and several journalists, the students bought subway tickets and boarded the uptown line with the intention of delivering an early-morn-ing reminder of the consequences of war. It was not until the students attempted to reprise their performance on the downtown subway line that they were surrounded by 20 undercover police officers and placed under arrest. The five students were charged with loitering and obstructing governmental administration, and were released by 10:30 p.m.

In an article written in the 9.9.04 issue of The Miscellany News, George Lee '05 explained that he joined the protest due to the enormity of the destruction. ""Kill all the students at Vassar five times,"" said Lee. ""That's the number of lives lost. The beauty gone forever."" Historic rally defends women's rights More than 200 Vassar students were among the 500,000 to 800,000 people that gathered in Washington, D.C. for the March for Women's Lives on April 25, 2004 to protest President Bush's policies on abortion, reproductive rights, and women's rights. A ""march coalition"" of campus organizations, such as the Feminist Majority Leadership Alliance, the Women's Health Center, and the Campus Health Organization for Information (CHOICE), had been organizing transportation for students since October. Protestors at the March, both male and female, hailed from 60 different countries, and the demonstration was deemed

""Kill all the students at Vassar five times,"" said Lee. ""That's the number of lives lost. The beauty gone forever.""

the largest in U.S. history. Speakers like Whoopi Goldberg and Hillary Clinton roused enthusiasm during the event, and afterwards, women bearing banners and wearing prochoice clothing marched peaceably through central Washington, D.C. After returning from the event, student protestor Adrienne Weisner '04 reflected on the protest's central issues in the April 30, 2004 issue of The Miscellany News. ""Americans demonstrated that we will not remain silent while a radically conservative administration gradually encroaches on our basic civil liberties,"" said Weisner.

In the same spirit of self-efficacy, Vassar students have coordinated on-campus efforts to make lasting changes to College policies, often in response to political and social issues on the national level. Campus poll brings suffrage to forefront Inez Milholland, Class of 1909, spearheaded the suffrage movement at Vassar and received

media attention in 1908 when she helped organize a panel on women's voting rights featuring speakers Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Rose Schneiderman, Helen Hoy, and Harriot Stanton Blatch. In March 1909, Milholland created a poll to gauge students' opinions of women's suffrage. The poll incited a campus debate in which students and professors publicly discussed its findings. College President James Monroe Taylor objected to the debate because he had not expected professors to voice their opinions, and many professors were in favor of suffrage. Shortly after the debate, a petition advocating uninhibited discussion at Vassar on women's suffrage was circulated. At the time, there was also a suffrage club on campus. After Taylor's retirement in February 1914, Henry Noble MacCracken became president, and claimed to sympathize with the suffrage movement. But when Milholland (by then a graduate) tried to continue suffrage activism on campus, MacCracken's administration frustrated her efforts by prohibiting advertisements for demonstrations and forbidding her to speak out on campus for suffrage. Not until the U.S. entered World War I did MacCracken allow a suffrage conference on Vassar's campus. At this point, MacCracken also chose to publicly support a New York state referendum on female suffrage. Students take over Main for new program The College's failure to implement an African-American Studies program led 35 students to occupy Main Building in protest from Oct. 30 to Nov. 1, 1969. Eight days before the protest, six representatives from the Students' Afro-American Society (SAS) had presented nine demands regarding the creation of the program to College President Alan Simpson, and set Oct. 27 as the deadline for the College to make a commitment. Simpson reportedly wrote back rejecting most of the demands. No commitment had been made by Oct. 27, so the SAS took action. Participants in the sit-in quietly entered Main at 3:20 a.m. on Oct. 30. The students asked Security to leave, and nailed the center entrance and side doors shut. They also sealed off the main lobby, the switchboard, the Post Office, the bookstore, and The Retreat. Simpson was not notified until shortly after 6:05 a.m. The three-day sit-in ended after Simpson agreed to form an Africana Studies program at Vassar. The involvement of current Vassar students in activist causes builds upon a tradition of activism that began in the early years of the College's existence. ""Vassar women have been strong and dedicated for many decades,"" said Rebecca McGill '04, who attended the March for Women's Lives. ""It made me proud...to demonstrate that Vassar continues to be a college filled with people who fight for what they believe in.""

On Saturday, Jan. 27, over 100 Vassar students, teachers, and faculty members attended an anti-war protest in Washington, D.C. The march was organized primarily by United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ), a coalition of over 1,300 local and national groups opposed to the war in Iraq, and it drew crowds from across the country. The Vassar delegation joined thousands of other protestors, estimated at 500,000 by UFPJ but at ""tens of thousands"" by major news organizations' coverage of the event. The event started around 11 a.m. with a rally at the National Mall, which fed into the afternoon march. Speakers included Reverend Jesse Jackson, Representative Dennis Kucinich (D--OH), Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA), and actors Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Danny Glover, and Jane Fonda. The marchers filled the streets, and additional protestors participated from the sidewalks and the steps of surrounding buildings. While marching, protestors shouted chants such as, ""President Bush, hear our shout. Women say ""Pull Out,'"" and ""Show me what democracy looks like! This is what democracy looks like!"" A few bands played amidst the crowd, and many participants wore elaborate costumes, including imitations of President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in jail uniforms. According to Black Student Union President Victor Ray '07, the Vassar contingent began as an effort from Associate Professor of Sociology Diane Harriford, which he joined along with Professor of Sociology Eileen Leonard, Associate Professor of History Ismail Rashid, Assistant Professor of Geography Joe Nevins, Director of Religious and Spiritual Life Sam Speers, Student Activists Union President Jason Wu, and Wayne Nealis of the Field Work Office. Various programs and departments at the College sponsored the trip, including Women's Studies, American Culture, Geography and Geology, Africana Studies, the Fieldwork Office and the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life. The Vassar students were joined by 20 Poughkeepsie community members, teachers and students from Oakwood Friends school, and local senior citizens, along with seven Vassar faculty and staff members. When asked why she attended the march, Kelly Stout '10 replied, ""It's important that we put pressure on Congress and the president to

find a non-military solution to the problem they've created."" The police presence was heavy, and individual protestors occasionally stepped out of bounds, but the march was generally free of violence. The protest's unifying theme was peace, though factions addressed more specific issues. Many held signs that read, ""Iraq Escalation is the Wrong Way,"" and ""Impeach Bush."" Others asked Congress to end the war or demanded an end to ""blood for oil."" ""I don't think the war was justified in the first place,"" said Amanda Waterhouse '10, who participated in both last Saturday's march and the anti-war marches in San Francisco last year. ""The troop surge accentuates the wrongs of the war. There's no way it's going to work, and it's just going to cause more loss of life,"" she said. At Vassar, the peace march was preceded by a discussion panel entitled ""War, Peace, and Justice"" on Thursday, Jan. 25. During the discussion three professors and one student gave their thoughts on war in general, the war in Iraq, and civil disobedience.

Christine Vines Guest Writer

Imagine an issue that both President George W. Bush and Vassar College students agree upon. The Farm Bill Extension Act of 2007 goes to the Senate this month and for once, both Bush and Vassar students are pushing for major agricultural reform. On Friday, Sept. 21, 10 Vassar students joined 70 other concerned students from 17 different colleges and universities to make their case heard in Washington, D.C. Vassar students from Operation Donation, Hunger Action and the College Democrats were all represented at the National Student Day of Action for an Equitable Farm Bill. Students also set up tables lined with phones in the College Center and encouraged those who could not attend the protest to call their senators about the bill. The 2007 Farm Bill addresses three main issues: domestic food programs including school lunches and food stamps, commodity subsidies and environmental conservation. The federal government periodically adopts broad farm bills, which set overall agricultural policy. Farms bills can be highly controversial, impacting environmental preservation, trade, food production, and the well-being of rural communities. The agricultural subsidy programs mandated by the farm bills are the subject of especially intense debate. Although there was some lastminute Republican opposition and a veto threat in the House, the bill passed by a margin of 40 votes. Vassar Student Association (VSA) Vice President for Activities Jimmy Kelly '09 co-organized of the Day of Action in D.C. 'The same or more opposition is still possible in the Senate, but ""it is almost guaranteed to become law,"" said Kelly. Students lobbying on Friday called for a change to the current policy on commodity subsidies. The first Farm Bill was drafted as a part of President Roosevelt's New Deal to provide subsidies to small farmers during the Depression. Today, the bill has a similar reputation, but many believe it does just the opposite. ""We think the Farm Bill is designed to help the small farmer,"" said Kelly. ""But when five crops receive 90 percent of the subsidies and the top 10 percent of recipients receive more than 70 percent of all money paid out, it seems clear that we are reinforcing privilege rather than fighting social and economic ills."" The current food bill has also been criticized for providing enormous subsidies to certain industries lowering the cost of junk foods that use products like high-fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated soybean oil. To protest the delineation of subsidies, Kelly and fellow students conducted meetings with more than fortyfive senators and held a televised press

conference in which participants gave speeches and performed a symbolic ""cotton dumping,"" in which students covered themselves in cotton to represent the dumping of our crops on developing countries. Madeleine Newbold '11 was one of seven Vassar freshmen to take part in the day's events. ""It was an amazing experience overall,"" said Newbold. ""How many people can say their first

""The reality is that we have farm subsidies now because we've had them for a long time.""

trip to D.C. was spent lobbying in favor of a bill that has the potential to diminish poverty internationally as well as improve health and environmental standards here?"" ""I think we were very well heard,"" Kelly said. ""We put a ton of research into the bill and the political feasibilities of the proposals we introduced, and I think the people we met with were generally impressed and willing to hear us."" These students are hopeful that their efforts will result in major changes in the Senate, because thus far, according to Kelly, ""little more than cosmetic changes have been made."" There are also those who hold a more radical hope for the future of the Farm Bill, among them Associate Professor of Economics Alan Marco. ""My personal opinion is that we should end farm subsidies,"" said Marco. ""We were on a trajectory to do

this some years ago with the Freedom to Farm Act of 1996, but it was replaced with continued subsidies in 2002. The new Farm Bill redefines the way in which subsidies are calculated, but it does not do away with them."" But no changes can occur without the efforts of passionate citizens. Kelly strongly urged students to write their senators, assuring that ""if they hear the voices, they'll make change."" ' Marco agreed that change will only

result from deliberate and concerted actions. ""The reality is that we have farm subsidies now because we've had them for a long time,"" he said. ""It's always difficult to take back an entitlement, even when it's inefficient."" The National Day of Action brought together students of a similar mind to enact this change. Alex Sheff '08 expressed his satisfaction with the movement. ""There is a lot of talking about important issues here at Vassar, and that's great,"" said Sheff. ""There are very smart people here with a lot of interesting things to say, but what this trip did was bring those interesting ideas to the people who have the power to make decisions.""

Months of contract negotiations for many Vassar College employees may be coming to an end. Members of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 200 United, who work in areas such as Buildings and Grounds, Custodial Services and Campus Dining, have been in the process of renewing their contract since July 1, 2008, when their 2005 contract expired. Approximately 250 College employees belong to SEIU. Negotiations between the College and the union have been difficult. On Thursday, Oct. 16, approximately 200 employees held a demonstration outside of Main Building. A similar demonstration was held the following day, which about 100 people attended. Faculty members, students and campus employees participated in the rallies, which Vice President of the Local 200 United Mike Lonigro thought were ""well and broadly attended."" On both days, the workers marched from the All Campus Dining Center, through the College Center, and ended in Main Circle. The demonstration began around noon and ended around 12:30 p.m. The two demonstrations were held to coincide with the meeting of the Board of Trustees on campus. Retirement health benefits are emerging

as the central concern of this year's negotiations. ""Health care is in a crisis situation in our society,"" said Lonigro. ""And nowhere more so than for senior citizens, particularly retired senior citizens. Too often, it's a choice between a worker paying for his wife's prescription or putting food on the table every night."" The previous contract, which went into effect on July 1, 2005, expired on June 30, 2008. Employees and College administrators also faced disagreements three years ago, and health benefits were also a primary concern in those negotiations. That negotiation, too, saw demonstrations, including one student-organized protest on Sept. 8, 2005 that drew more than 100 participants in support of SEIU. Currently, Vassar's SEIU employees pay for post-retirement medical expenses using a combination of Medicare and Vassar's pension plan, in which the College uses a formula to calculate pension after retirement. ""It's not a bad plan, and we're happy to continue with it,"" said Lonigro. However, the union is pushing for a pension increase, citing the ballooning cost of healthcare and prescription drugs. ""The cost of medication has increased substantially,"" continued Lonigro. SEIU representatives have pushed the College to adopt a union-based healthcare plan, which would provide greater retirement benefits to employees. However, this plan would require the College

to sign on to a multi-employer healthcare pension plan stipulating that, should the health care insurance provider for the employees go bankrupt, the College would

cover the retirees' medical bills. The College would then have to dip into its budget to pay for these bills.

According to Associate Vice President for Human Resources Ruth Spencer, the College does not want to risk ""legal and fiscal liability of College assets should something go wrong"" by signing on to the SEIU postretirement medical plan. ""At this point, we are trying to tic up details, [but] a post-retirement health plan is not on the table,"" she said. Spencer believes that current health coverage for employees is excellent compared to the coverage at other institutions. ""[Members of the SEIU] are the only employee group that doesn't contribute copays, pay no deductibles and have no premium contribution for themselves, their spouses or their dependents,"" she said. ""That is a very rich plan and almost unheard of in the rest of the world."" Spencer noted the pressures placed on the College given the current economic crunch. ""The pie is much smaller,"" she said. ""And sure, you can keep cutting the pie into the same number of pieces, but each piece is smaller and smaller."" Most union representatives did not have great sympathy for the College's current financial position. ""A $1 billion institution doesn't have to

sweat the bills for a lot of things here, and the bills shouldn't come off of your backs,"" said Lonigro through a bullhorn to a crowd of workers at the Oct. 17 demonstration. Local 200 United represents employees with similar jobs at both Marist College and Bard College. Marist agreed to adopt the union-based healthcare plan, while Bard adopted a system whereby workers may retire at age 60, and the College will pay 50 percent of their health care costs for the rest of their lives. ""This wasn't the union plan,"" Lonigro noted, ""but we're open-minded. We're willing to work with administrations to devise the best system of care for our employees."" Despite ongoing progress, many employees engaging in the demonstrations were visibly angry at the administration and fearful of their financial situations, especially given the current economy. ""What they're doing is really inhuman,"" said one custodial worker who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""I've been working here for 25 years, and every year it feels like it's for less and less. They don't understand what it takes to work in a place like this,"" she continued. ""I think they should all take a turn doing the cleaning, doing the electrical work, go-

ing down the plumbing holes."" Spencer was surprised at the workers' accusations, particularly those surrounding the strength of health benefits. ""One question seems to be, to what degree are they aware of what benefits are like outside of Vassar? For some workers, particularly those with such great longevity at the College, they might not realize what it would not like not to have Vassar's benefit structure,"" she said. The next stage of negotiations is slated to take place on Oct. 30. Many seemed optimistic that a settlement would be reached, particularly after the Oct. 24 negotiating session, though Lonigro noted that the negotiations are often an uphill battle. ""Today there was a little movement,"" he said following the session. ""We're seeing some progress, and I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll reach a settlement."" Vice President for the Union on Vassar's campus Cathy Bradford, was also optimistic about the negotiations. ""We're mainly talking about the pension plan and health benefits,"" said Bradford. ""But it sounds like we're going somewhere. [The administration] is getting tired. I hope they're getting tired.""

For the 103 members of the Vassar community who attended the National Equality March on Sunday, Oct. 11, the day began at 2:45 in the morning. According to Equality Across America, the organization running the event, the march was intended to demand ""equal protection for"" Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer people in all matters governed by civil law. Now."" For Vassar students, participation in the March meant a six-hour bus trip to Washington, D.C. and back, all in the span of 22 hours. ""It was quite a day,"" said Leah Varsano '10. The Vassar students and community members who attended the event were among the estimated 200,000 people who showed their support marching for LGBTQ rights, and for many, the experience was deeply personal. ""My moms are gay, but I'm more into this than my mothers are,""

said freshman Amanda Friedrich, ""They're like, 'go on honey, have fun.'"" Varsano added, ""I do feel that this is a defining movement for our time. I want to be able to tell my grandkids that I marched for gay rights."" The March followed a route that took protestors down Pennsylvania Avenue past the White House to end on the National Mall in front of the Capitol for a rally. There was an air of excitement and camaraderie at the March with participants holding up signs that ranged in tone from serious—""Slavery was tradition, too""— to humorous—""Gay marriage causes global warming because we're soooo hot."" In homage to Beyonce's song ""Single Ladies,"" one sign even read, ""We like it, and we wanna put a ring on it."" The March was supposed to kick off at n a.m., but ended up running a little behind schedule, adding to the excitement and impatience of the crowd. ""I'm ready to do this!"" said

Michelle Donnelly 'n. Donnelly is the secretary of ACT OUT, an LGBTQ. advocacy organization at Vassar that put the National Equality March at the top of its agenda this year. Donnelly, along with ACT OUT's executive board and coPresidents Leslie Hamilton '10 and Casey Katims '10, helped plan Vassar's contribution to the March. ""We would have been happy with 30 people,"" said Hamilton, who was surprised by the unexpected turnout and enthusiasm from Vassar students and administrators. But the road to Washington, D.C. wasn't bump free for ACT OUT. When Hamilton and Katims realized turnout would be closer to 100, they realized ""we're going to be working twice as hard,"" said Katims. Hamilton and Katims began planning participation in the March last June when Equality Across America

announced the possibility of a march in October. The two exchanged daily e-mails, realizing that a successful march was going to require lots of planning over the summer. When the school year began, it was time to start fundraising. Despite efforts on their own—including a bake sale offering ""gayke""—ACT OUT needed the financial support of the Vassar Student Association (VSA). So the ACT OUT executive board attended a VSA council meeting to make their case. ""It's politically active, and it's socially conscious. This is exactly the type of event you should be funding,"" said Katims. It worked. Both Hamilton and Katims declared Vassar's participation in the March a success, and were grateful to the VSA for it's support. The pair was ""amazed"" by the amount of work the ACT OUT executive board put into the planning process so Vassar students and community members could attend. ACT OUT was also thankful to VSA organizations and campus houses that contributed funds and provided support. ""Everyone has worked harder than I've ever seen them work before. Il really was a collective effort. All hands on deck,"" said Katims. He added with a tired smile, ""It was a beautiful, beautiful effort."" As with any march, there were risks associated with the National Equality March. March organizers had expected counter-protestors, particularly from the Westboro Baptist Church, a religious group that has now become famous for its conservative anti-gay positions. Yet ACT OUT encountered no counter-protestors during the march, though Katims and Hamilton were unable to pinpoint why exactly. ""It's hard to imagine they just took the day off,"" said Katims. But the march did raise questions about the relationship between religion—particularly some groups within the Christian church—and the LGBTQrights movement. In addition to the 100-plus Vassar students in attendance, the Reverend Jennifer Barrows, affiliate Advisor to the Episcopal Church of Vassar College (ECVC), joined Vassar's group. During the March, Barrows carried a sign that read, ""End the Harm From Religion-based Bigotry and Prejudice."" The sign was provided by Faith in America, a multi-denominational Christian organization that rejects faith-based discrimination against LGBTQ individuals. ""I was stopped five times by gay couples to get my picture taken,"" said Reverend Barrows, pointing to her clerical collar, ""It was wonderful. I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to do this."" Reverend Harrows shed light on some of the tensions gay rights has provoked in religious communities across the United States: ""[There's al cavern between Christian Faith and what Jesus says."" Harrows had a strong condemnation for the way some practitioners of the Christian faith have created ""layers and layers of mistrust, hurt, animosity and—what's worse—indifference"" toward LGBTQ individuals. But Barrows was quick to point out that there is by no means a unified voice on I.GRTQrights among Christian denominations. ""We're losing whole diocese over this issue"" she said, referring to Episcopal parishes that have withdrawn their support for the denomination because of the consecration of gay bishops.

Divides exist within the LGBTQrights movement as well. Katims is currently writing his senior thesis on ""divisions that exist within the LGBTQ, movement in the United States"" but does feel that ""the movement is changing"" and becoming more inclusive of LGBTQ people of various races, classes and genders. Hamilton agreed that the movement is gaining momentum. ""There are a lot of reasons it's taken this long,"" she said. ""One thing that comes to mind is that you can hide your gender or sexual orientation in a way that is different from hiding your race. People are now saying, 'I'm done hiding,' and it took a long time for that to be an option. Some say the movement is finally 'coming out of the closet,' and I think I agree with that."" Katims spent the second semester of his junior year in Washington, D.C. interning at the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), an organization that lobbies the federal government for LGBTQ equality. He also spent time over the summer as an intern at the U.S. House of Representatives. He said the two opportunities gave him experience working both within the government and from outside. He couldn't say which he preferred: ""It's a debate I have with myself,"" he said. But katims does believe the LGBTQrights movement needs openly gay men and women to work both outside and within the U.S. lawmaking body. He added, ""Progress will never be achieved unless there are also people pushing from the outside."" Katims' experience at HRC involved lobbying much more than marching, but Katims and ACT OUT still see a place for direct actionsuch as marching—in the LGBTQ movement. ""Marches energize people,"" said Hamilton. Katims said he does not see marching as an outdated form of activism at all, remarking, ""When you have 100,000 bodies in a single location, that's something that can't be replicated by Facebook or Twitter, or even a lobby action."" This spirit of physical action is even present in ACT OUT's name. Said Hamilton, ""An action is something you do one day as part of something within a larger narrative of working toward a goal, which for ACT OUT is gay rights."" Hamilton added, ""You protest against something. You act for something."" ""Marches are a form of protest people are used to seeing associated with civil rights,"" said Hamilton, drawing a parallel between the LGBTQ rights movement to the American Civil Rights movement of the 19605. Among the differences Katims noted, however, is that ""the LGBTQ rights movement is led by organizations instead of people."" Their nonviolent ties to the movement of the '60s became evident at the rally when Katims received a text message from the organizers alerting him to the potential for violent antimarch action along the route. He responded with unwavering stoicism: ""We are nonviolent. We don't fight back."" Despite bumps in the road, the outlooks on the future of the LGBTQ movement were overwhelmingly positive. Said Varsano, ""I think [equality for LGBTQ couples! is inevitable. I really do. It's a matter of how long and how much hardship. But it will happen."" Hamilton agreed and pushed for more action, stating, ""It's time to be open about the fact that all Americans aren't equal.""

Jessica Tarantine Features Editor

The Vassar Greens are currently mounting a campaign for the College to divest fully from fossil fuels. While originally a grassroots movement from the Greens, the campaign has gained support from other organizations, such as the Feminist Alliance, Vassar Animal Rights Collation, and the Grassroots Alliance for Alternative Politics. The Vassar Student Association (VSA) is currently considering a resolution to support the Greens’ campaign. With this campaign, Vassar joins one hundred other schools which have made similar demands of their administrations. The divestment movement has been gaining momentum but has yet to see wide-scale action; While many schools are adopt-

ing more sustainable practice both physically and fiscally, only Unity College in Maine, a school with a mission involving environmental sustainability has announced its intent to divest in fossil fuels. Indeed, despite a student referendum with 72 percent of students supporting divestment, Harvard University decided not to divest, ignoring student concerns. The Greens’ proposal, which is available for public viewing on the group’s Facebook page, reads: “We believe that Vassar has tremendous potential to lead our peer colleges and universities in this historic transition to a thriving, just, sustainable future.” The document, which calls for complete and public divestment from fossil fuels, was written after the organization received word that the College holds investments in the fossil

fuel industry. While the proposal lists holdings in companies such as Exxon, BP and Shell, the Greens explained that they were more interested in divestment from the industry as a whole rather than divestment from specific companies. “Our ultimate goal is complete and public divestment from the industry itself,” said Divestment Campaign Co-coordinator Noah Bogdonoff ’14. To put their plans into action, Greens’ representatives have met with Director of Investments/Associate Vice President for Finance and Administration Stephen Dahnert, Dean of Strategic Planning Marianne Begemann and the Campus Investor Responsibility Committee (CIRC), a joint committee comprised of students, alumnae/i, faculty and administrators. Chaired by Begemann, it reports its recommendations to the Board of Trustee’s subcommittee on investor responsibility. Administrators fear that co-mingled funds complicate divestment possibilities The exact amount of Vassar’s endowment invested in fossil fuels is hard to determine. While the College can tell that 8-9% of its endowment is invested in fossil fuels through co-mingled funds—which are similar to mutual funds and publish their holdings—and direct ownership of stocks, it is unable to determine the amount invested in hedge funds, which do not publish the companies they invest in as the information is considered proprietary. Investments in hedge funds account for roughly 30% of the College’s endowment. But Vice President for Finance and Administration Betsy Eismeier did give a figure for the amount the College holds direct investments and in portfolios which we know contain fossil fuel companies. “My understanding is that we know of about $73 million in the portfolio spread across a wide number of underlying fund managers that is invested in companies producing fossil fuel,” she wrote in an emailed statement. Dahnert noted that while it is impossible to know whether hedge funds contain companies that produce fossil fuels, it is possible to get a general idea of how hedge funds are investing, citing The Russell 3000 stock index, which shows that 10% of the current investment market is in energy. During the CIRC meeting held last Wednesday, the Committee considered the Greens’ proposal to determine if it should recommend divestment. “The meeting confirmed what I thought: it’s a great proposal and the people involved are really passionate but its not something that is sustainable right now. A lot of money is in these companies,” said VSA VP for Finance and CIRC member Alex Koren ’13. “More complicated is that a lot of these investments are in funds which are hard to pull out and impossible to pull out without pulling other investments,” continued Koren, who said divestment would be difficult without harming returns on the endowment. Danhert shared Koren’s concerns and further explained that most of Vassar’s investments are co-mingled funds, not direct investment. “Divestment would be highly disruptive as a practical matter given Vassar’s heavy use of co-mingled investment funds, many of which have some energy exposure,” he wrote. “We cannot direct specific investments made by these fund managers and so would have to exit perhaps half of our current managers if we were to truly divest energy holdings. This would be extremely impractical from a management standpoint, and also costly.” Possibilities for re-investment Despite logistical challenges, Campaign Co-Coordinator Gabe Dunsmith ’15 is optimistic that the College could successfully divest. “The research we’ve done indicates that there are several ways that the College could withdraw fossil fuel companies from its endowment: 1) Using a different investments agency, 2) directing its agency to divest from fossil fuel, or 3) creating a new green mutual fund that would not include any fossil fuel companies. Specifically their proposal suggests the MSCI KLD 400, a socially responsible fund.” The Greens explained that while the fund did have some holdings in fossil fuels, it was more

attractive than Vassar’s current holdings as it had less exposure to the companies in question. The Greens’ proposal reads: “Utilities and energy comprise only ~7.5% of the index’s market weight, and some of these companies are undoubtedly producing renewables. As it stands, the minimal participation of coal, natural gas and oil companies in this index make it an attractive option for reinvestment.” It further states, “Should Vassar’s current brokers feel unable or unwilling to investigate this option, a number of socially-responsible investment firms have expressed interest in helping Vassar make the transition.” Specifically, the proposal points to a firm called MSCI, which offers an environmentally responsible fund with lucrative returns. It reads “[MSCI] provides many comprehensive indices that point to safe and/or lucrative investments in the fields of pollution prevention, green building, sustainable water, and green technology. In addition, certain renewable energies (in particular, wind) are seeing rapid growth year-over-year, and with the re-election of President Obama will likely continue to grow.” The proposal also suggested that it would be feasible to spread the College’s current investments in fossil fuels across other current investments. It states, “The success of Vassar’s endowment in the past year (especially in comparison with other elite colleges) indicates that spreading the divested funds across the rest of our remaining portfolio would stabilize the endowment while more lucrative alternatives are being sought out.” College cites financial effects on endowment Economically, the Greens explained that minimizing fossil fuel holdings would stabilize returns on the endowment. “Fossil fuel investments are inherently risky in the long-term...it is likely that national or international regulatory measures will cripple this industry in the coming years,” reads the proposal. Associate Professor of Economics Ben Ho disagreed with this analysis. “Economics says that all investments are inherently risky. And there is no reason at all to avoid riskier investments since riskier investments provide higher returns,” he said. “Energy is a lot less risky than, say, tech investments like Apple.” But both Eismeier and Dahnert share concerns that divestment from fossil fuels could hinder endowment performance. “Historically, fossil fuel investments have been an important component of investment return, so divestment could hinder our ability to generate required returns going forward, perhaps significantly,” wrote Dahnert. Eismeier agreed, writing, “Divesting from energy investments would not be prudent, in my opinion, given Vassar’s dependence on returns produced by the endowment to fulfill the College’s core mission.” One third of Vassar’s operating budget comes from the endowment annually.

Koren explained his concerns as a VSA Executive Board member, “My understanding is that if we divested completely, we would take a hit. Things central to our mission statement like student to teacher ratio and need blind financial aid could be affected.” But during the Student Life Committee meeting last Monday, campaign representatives explained that it would be unlikely the endowment would see a reduction in value. Bogdonoff elaborated in an emailed statement, “It is important to understand that even in a worst-case scenario, the endowment won’t shrink. While uninvested funds don’t grow, they also can’t be lost.” Bogdonoff continued, emphasizing the campaign’s efforts on collaborating with the College. “We are working hard to recruit the administration, CIRC and the Board of Trustees to help us create a divestment plan that keeps Vassar’s endowment growth on track.” Considering divestment as a moral issue The Greens’ proposal identified divestment as a prominently moral issue. “The act of divestiture is, at its heart, a moral stand. The corporations listed below have committed atrocities against the citizens that they purport to serve. These corporations regularly and deliberately abuse public health, the global environment, and human rights.” Others agreed the decision to divest had to be made on moral terms. “Whether you divest or not is an ethical question that economics cannot answer,” said Ho. The Greens’ explained that coal burning is linked to 21,000 American deaths and 300,000 cases of acute cardiac and respiratory illnesses every year. While community members might be tempted to view the decision to divest in only economic terms, Bogdonoff explained that economic issues were impossible to divorce from moral issues. “While there are many moral reasons to divest—public health, worker safety, global warming, mass pollution, etc.—and many economic reasons to divest—long-term instability of the fossil fuel industries, changing political climates, etc.)—it’s best to understand that economic decisions are moral decisions.” The Greens also explained the pure environmental costs. “Coal extraction is made possible through clear-cutting and mountaintop removal across Southern Appalachia. These acts fragment ecosystems and destroy habitats for species of microorganisms, plants, and mammals that make human life feasible.” While Ho thought divestment was an ethical issue, he questioned the environmental impact of divestment on a national level. “Reduced investment in natural gas will likely lead to greater reliance on coal which is twice as emitting or nuclear since most renewables are too expensive and lack sufficient capacity,” said Ho, explaining the effects of divesting in one of the main types of fossil fuels . “Natural gas has been a key reason

why the US emissions have been declining steadily in recent years. Shifting away from coal is more justifiable, but that is already happening anyway because of recent regulations and the low natural gas prices.” “Economics suggests that the choice of energy should be decided based on cost-benefit analysis and efficient carbon prices rather than categorical exclusions of certain energy types,” he concluded. Eismeier pointed out the College burns fossil fuels for heat on campus. “It seems inconsistent at best to use fossil fuels but not invest in the producing companies,” wrote Eismeier. “We would pay the high price for the fuel but not receive the benefit of investment return, generated partly by our own usage.” Dahnert was also skeptical that divestment would achieve meaningful changes in the companies’ management. “I believe that divestment is also a questionable protest strategy because it would have essentially no impact on the companies involved, given both our very small ownership stake and the fact that our shares would be picked up by other investors, not sold back to these companies,” explained Dahnert. “For example, our known equity position in Chevron (one of the names on the list developed by the Vassar students) equals just 0.0002% of the company’s shares. Were we to sell all of our shares, the trade would be just 0.6% of the average daily trading volume for the stock. Such a sale would not move the price of the stock or impact the company in any way,” he finished. Bogdonoff explained that the divestment campaign was not only about the practical but also about the message sent by investing in these companies. “When we spend money—especially when we invest—we are making monetized decisions about what we value,” he said. “I do feel safe in saying that it is the Campaign’s deep hope that the College will no longer choose to ignore the moral and ethical decisions it’s making by staying invested in fossil fuels,” he finished. In contrast to divestment, Dahnert instead suggested continuing to have ownership in the companies and using that part ownership to petition the management and make positive changes in the company. “Vassar has used these positive engagement strategies for years through the Trustees Investor Responsibility Committee and CIRC and while the impact may be gradual, we believe it can influence corporate behavior over time, particularly if other investors use the same approach,” he wrote. Despite the challenges going forward, Greens’ members were optimistic. “It is our great hope that the College would ultimately save money by not being tied up with risky investments like coal, oil, and natural gas,” said Dunsmith. “We’d like to see Vassar invest in a future of green energy instead of a future of climate destruction. It’s our hope that we can work with the Administration to build a more robust, healthy, and socially-con-scious investment portfolio.”

Bethan Johnson News Editor

While February 28 will stand as a significant day in the lives of many Vassar students because of the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) protest and Vassar’s responsive programming, the same date will also prove to be a significant but more somber one for the neighboring West Point Military Academy. Hours before the WBC’s promised picket outside our gates, members of the church will gather at West Point to protest the funeral of General Norman Schwarzkopf, an alumnus who died at the age of 78. Just as these last few weeks have prompted students to reflect on the significance of tolerance and activism in the face of hate, I think we should also use our shared status as targets to consider our connections with West Point and all servicemen and servicewomen. Picketing funerals, especially military ones, is one of the most notorious tactics the WBC uses to spread its message. Much like its reason for protesting against Vassar, the group’s website cites the military’s tolerance for homosexuality as its reason for picketing Gen. Schwarzkopf’s funeral. According to its website, “The truth is that all these soldiers are fighting for the right of fags to marry—the same sin for which the Lord destroyed the world with a great flood…Military funerals have become pagan orgies of idolatrous blasphemy…” Although criticisms of our two institutions have similar sources, the words and aims differ in some significant ways. Based on previous events, the church will look to disrupt Vassar’s daily activities and attack our communities’ values. However, at funeral protests the church specifically rejoices in death and advocates for more bloodshed. The WBC’s anti-military protests include holding up signs that say ‘Thank

God for Dead Soldiers’ and ‘Thank God for IEDs’; protestors have also sung and yelled in the past in order to disrupt services or to be heard by mourners as they enter or leave. The WBC seeks to shame those attending the funeral and dishonor the dead. I know that not everyone at Vassar supports what the military and institutions like West Point stand for. There are probably many at West Point who do not share all of our convictions. However, I still believe that the hateful rhetoric of the WBC highlights our common goals. While Vassar students may disagree with the military as an institution or its policies on sexual identity and women’s issues, we should support the West Point community and those individuals who are also suffering at the hands of the WBC’s hatred. WBC’s message of hate and intolerance is universally unacceptable. This support becomes even more critical because West Point cadets are banned from responding to the protest. The Academy’s regulations prohibit cadets from counter-pro-testing the funeral picket in any way, and this leaves the community without the feelings of institutional and campus-wide support that Do Something VC and other groups seek to provide our campus. There is a tragic irony in this scenario because these cadets, now unable to protests this hate speech, may be called to fight to defend the right to free speech that allows the WBC to vocalize their hateful message. In response to the unacceptable messages of the WBC and the cadets’ inability to engage with the group, Vassar students have created the West Point Solidarity Committee. In order to show Vassar’s commitment to supporting the grieving family and the cadets, the committee has created banners to be displayed on both

campuses that read ‘United We Stand Against Hatred.’ Moreover, the committee has drafted a letter to cadets stating, despite differing opinions on other issues, their support of the West Point community in the face of such hate, and their hopes for more work towards common goals. This letter will be read to the cadets as they all gather in the dining hall on Thursday, as well as to West Point’s commandants. Copies of this letter can be found and signed on Do Something VC’s website, the group’s Facebook page, or the online edition of this article. I implore students who detest the messages of the WBC to read and sign the letter of solidarity. These letters will also show our support of all those cadets who are personally harmed by the WBC’s message. While these signatures mark a valuable and tangible way of recognizing our connections with West Point, Vassar students should remember that our ties to West Point and the American military run deep and will continue to grow in the coming months. These relationships should not be ignored, but rather embraced for their potential to inspire growth and understanding from individuals at both institutions. Throughout its history, hundreds of Vassar students have family members who have served, or are currently serving, in the military; this semester Vassar also welcomed its first active combat veteran to campus. This number will grow next semester when Vassar enrolls 11 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans through the Veterans’ Posse Program that President Hill created. Vassar also has been building an academic and educational exchange with West Point through the Vassar-West Point Initiative. Arguably Vassar’s most visible connection with West Point, the initiative brings cadets to our campus, and then allows Vassar students access to their daily life as well. The program

brings students and cadets together in order to bridge the divide between the military and civilian communities; both military and civilian educators believe that bridging this divide is critical to ensuring a thriving democracy. Vassar’s mission statement encourages us to embrace diversity of perspective and experience; although we may never agree on some issues, developing our bond with West Point represents one form of achieving this aim. Moreover, the Academy’s connection with Vassar will help them as they look to develop their institution’s acceptance of LGBTQ cadets. In the aftermath of the repeal of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’ West Point is continuing to expand its LGBTQ support system. Knights Out, a group of West Point alumni and faculty that work to support LGBT-identified soldiers, and other groups are growing their presence on the campus. Collaboration between Vassar students and West Point cadets on issues of gender, sexuality, and race would strengthen both parties. While it may seem easy to identify the differences in our campuses, these links and the WBC’s attacks remind me just how much our institutions have in common. A common phrase in our discussions about our responses to WBC is ‘it should be about us, not them.’ I support this statement and challenge students to consider the cadets, and General Schwarzkopf’s grieving family members, as part of this ‘us.’ We share a community and aspirations of a better world with these cadets, even though we might not always share the means of achieving these goals. As we face the attacks from the WBC, Vassar should insist on solidarity with the West Point cadets. —Bethan Johnson ‘15 is a History and English double major.

On Sunday, February 17, three cars departed from Vassar College at 5:00 a.m. en route to Washington D.C., where they met several other Vassar students among over 40,000 activists in front of the Washington Monument. This was the “biggest climate rally by far, by far, by far in U.S. history,” according to activist Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, renowned author, and the keynote speaker at the march. At this march we asked President Obama to live up to his promise to move forward on climate change and reject the proposal for the Keystone XL Pipeline. Keystone XL is a proposal for a pipeline that would stretch from Alberta, Canada down to the U.S., transporting crude oil extracted from Canadian tar sands across more than a thousand miles. Although there has been much dispute about the exact path of the pipeline, it would have to cut through some part of the Midwest and end up in the Gulf of Mexico. This path not only cuts through America’s heartland and a major aquifer, but also intrudes on the land of many Canadian indigenous tribes. Canadian energy company TransCanada, a self-described “leader in the responsible development and reliable operation of North American energy infrastructure,” is responsible for this project. It is the duty of our generation to be insistent that this pipeline not be allowed for several reasons. The first is the fact that this pipeline poses a large threat to everywhere it passes through. The technology is not perfect. Leaks are inevitable. These leaks threaten to ruin the Ogallala Aquifer, one of the largest in the United States. This aquifer is responsible for the drinking water of millions of people, and also supplies water for a large amount of U.S. agriculture. But more importantly, we simply

cannot allow the fossil fuels that this pipeline would bring us to enter our atmosphere. The dirty emissions from this pipeline only further climate change and do nothing to decrease our dependence on fossil fuels and foreign energy. This pipeline is thinking of the past; we cannot allow it because it does nothing to encourage an investment in clean renewable energies and technologies.

“It is the duty of our generation to insist that this pipeline not be allowed.” Alli Crook ’14

The February 17 protest, which began as a rally at noon with speakers such as Bill McKibben, Van Jones, indigenous leaders, a U.S. senator, and even a wealthy former investor, ended with a march that spanned several blocks around the capital, ending in front of the White House. The initial rally, led by Rev. Lennox Yearwood, got everyone excited with motivational and powerful speeches; 40,000 fists went up in solidarity with everyone who has had a hand in this fight. The rally was an important way for us to come together from different backgrounds, fields of speciality, and generations in order to stand collectively as one, unified people. The Keystone XL Pipeline is not an attack on the environment, it is an attack on people. Once in front of the White House, we turned our white signs over, above our heads, to form a large, black pipeline. As we marched, we chanted to Obama, “We are

unstoppable. A better world is possible.” After standing in the cold for four hours, we all piled back in our cars to return to Vassar by midnight, most of us having spent a full 12 hours in our car seats. This is not the first time Vassar has traveled to D.C. to take a stand specifically on the Keystone pipeline. In 2011, several Vassar students were arrested while protesting in front of the White House against the Pipeline. In November 2011, we also woke up at 5:00 a.m. to head to D.C.—although this act didn’t make us any better in pulling ourselves out of bed and into the cars this time around — only to return later that same afternoon. In 2011, we joined 10,000 others to form the first ever complete circle of protesters around the White House, followed by Obama’s initial rejection of the Keystone proposal several weeks later. Despite the enormous amount of work and organizing that we put in so far, we still had to come back this President’s Day—with 30,000 more friends—to make our feelings clear. Was it worth it? Absolutely. Rejecting this pipeline is of paramount importance to our future. As Bill McKibben pointed out in a personal web video he recently made for a campaign of the Vassar Greens, future generations are going to question what we did when we heard that the Arctic was melting, what we did when we saw unprecedented heat waves, and what we did when devastating natural disasters became an annual event? We will tell them that we stood up for the people who have already been affected by climate change, and for the future generations who will be affected with greater severity each day that our consumption of fossil fuels continues. We went to D.C. as many times as it took for us to be heard, and we are confident that we will win this fight for climate and social justice. —Alli Crook ‘14 is a Philosophy major."

Noble Ingram News Editor

On October 10, the newly formed Social Justice and Inclusion Fund Committee released the application to the fund of the same name to the general Vassar community. The committee, which is comprised of nine students, two administrators and one faculty member began working during the spring to establish a fund for projects committed to furthering the goals of social justice and inclusion. The first deadline for applications for the fund is November 1. The fund will hold several more application periods over the course of the year for interested groups and individuals. The fund was established as an additional resource for groups trying to support or facilitate social justice causes. Director for the Campus Life LGBTQ and Women’s Centers Judy Jarvis explained. “The short term goal is to fund projects of all kinds that focus on some social justice issue,” she said. The money came out of fundraising and movements that took place last year as a response to the Westboro Baptist Church’s protest of the college. The fund, therefore, aims to empower specific groups that were targeted by the Westboro Baptist Church protests. The fund organizers said in an emailed statement, “Whatever happened to the energy following Westboro’s visit to Vassar last February? Among other things, one of the great developments was the establishment of the Social Justice and Inclusion Fund through the donations of the immediate Vassar community and alumni.” One member of the committee, VP of Student Life, Genesis Hernandez ’15, spoke to his views of the future of the fund, expressing optimism for the opportunity groups now have to pursue programming specific to social justice issues. “I hope that through this fund we can see more diversity in programming on campus, not so much the structures of events but also

the mission statements behind events,” he said in an emailed statement. Hernandez continued, “While I think that the Social Consciousness Fund can also help promote diversity of thought, the great thing about the Social Justice and Inclusion Fund is that students don’t have to be affiliated with a VSA organization. This, thus, means that the fund is much more accessible, and it means that we can see events put on from all students on campus, not just those involved in affinity based organizations.” Jarvis went further, outlining the aims the fund. She said, “We want to empower students and Vassar employees to realize projects or initiatives that they’ve been wanting to do or think the campus needs but haven’t been able to fund

through other sources.” The first project that was funded actually took place over the summer. This program was called “The Vassar LGBTQ Oral History Project” and focused on stories of LGBTQ struggles against oppression and discrimination through the medium of oral history. The Chair of the Committee and Dean of Campus Life and Diversity Ed Pittman spoke to the many opportunities that this fund offers to members of the Vassar community. One thing Pittman emphasized was the student-focused approach the committee was taking in its deci-sion-making processes. Pittman noted, “We’re trying to ground this as much as we can in the experience of students. That’s the idea with having this many students on the committee

who can inform us.” Pittman also described how the particular fund fits into the context of Vassar in general. He recognized that discussions and efforts to improve the campus climate at Vassar happen often and that this fund is less groundbreaking as it is contributing to a larger sense of social justice. As Pittman stated, “I think that there are so many groups and communities within Vassar that live and try to carry out social justice. These initiatives are always happening.” He continued, “This is a fund that gives life to many of those initiatives. I don’t think it’s new to anything Vassar has been doing. This is a way of affirming the value and importance of that work.” Jarvis echoed this idea. She explained the possibilities of the fund, highlighting the fact that the committee is open to funding a wide variety of events and programs organized by a variety of groups and individuals. “The Committee is interested in funding projects that range from pilots like that to conference attendance to hosting dinner dialogues to research and presentation on a topic,” Jarvis explained. She also noted, “The beauty of the fund is that there are few limitations—we want applicants to get creative and propose projects that they think could benefit the campus and increase knowledge of and education on various social justice issues.” Hernandez agreed with this idea. “Essentially, there is no ideal structure to a potential event, the only actual requirement is that the event be focused on social justice and inclusion,” he said. Pittman also spoke to his hopes for the fund in the future. He recognized that the fund currently is a finite amount of money that can easily run out at the end of the year. He hopes for a more sustainable future for the fund. As he said, “Right now it’s a limited amount. Our goal is to work with others on campus to keep the fund going.”
